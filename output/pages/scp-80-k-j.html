[[include component:image-block name=SCP-80-K.jpg|caption=What SCP-80-K Prime thinks it looks like.]]

**Item #:** SCP-80-K-J

**Object Class:** Ridiculous

**Special Containment Procedures:** All instances of SCP-80-K-J are to be contained within Site 24&#39;s Secure Avian Anomalies Sector. [[[SCP-148|Telekill alloy]]][[footnote]]No, not really. It&#39;s just chicken wire.[[/footnote]] has been used to construct a flimsy, three meter high fence around a 10 m x 10 m area to prevent SCP-80-K-J from interfering with or attacking other poultry-related anomalies in containment. A small wooden barracks has also been provided for shelter. SCP-80-K-J is to be fed daily at 5:00 AM, 12:00 PM, and 6:00 PM.  Demands made by SCP-80-K Prime should be addressed in a patronizing tone and go unfulfilled.

**Description:** SCP-80-K-J is a group of 30 bird-like creatures that resemble domestic fowl adorned with M1 combat helmets. Each instance of SCP-80-K-J is armed with a small plastic rifle affixed to the underside of their left or right wing with an unidentified type of adhesive[[footnote]]It&#39;s probably Elmer&#39;s Glue. Would that surprise anyone?[[/footnote]]. SCP-80-K-J roughly functions as a military unit, and will only take orders from SCP-80-K Prime, though its ability to follow through on any directions given is limited. Aside from SCP-80-K Prime, members of SCP-80-K-J are incapable of speech, which hinders their ability to function as a team and properly act out most commands given to them[[footnote]]That time they tried to do jumping jacks together was hilarious though.[[/footnote]].

SCP-80-K-J Prime is the designation given to the highest ranking officer of SCP-80-K-J, discernible by the small general&#39;s hat it wears, and the crudely constructed medals[[footnote]]Looks like construction paper and glitter.[[/footnote]] pinned to its breast feathers. SCP-80-K Prime is capable of speech, though aside from a single interview (see Interview 80-K-1 below) given upon SCP-80-K-J&#39;s initial containment, it generally only speaks to make unreasonable demands[[footnote]]An Apache helicopter, an Abrams tank, the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, etc.[[/footnote]] of Foundation personnel and give orders to SCP-80-K-J.

SCP-80-K-J is usually aggressive towards most Foundation personnel, due to standing orders from SCP-80-K Prime to attempt escape from containment, with the exception of feeding times. Current containment procedures are more than sufficient to prevent SCP-80-K-J from escaping or causing harm to staff, though revisions will be considered if their behavior changes.

**Interview 80-K-1**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Schmirtz:** Hello, I am Dr. Schmirtz, and I will be conducting this interview with you.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-80-K Prime:** You will address me as &#34;Sir&#34;, as my rank entails, or face dire repercussions.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Schmirtz:** Nah, we&#39;ve decided to designate you as SCP-80-K Prime.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-80-K Prime:** I am General T██[[footnote]]I personally refer to it as &#34;R. Lee Turkey&#34;.[[/footnote]] of the Chicken Corps, and you will address me as &#34;Sir&#34; or be punished for insubordination!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Schmirtz:** ...You have to be shitting me. Your name is General T██? You can&#39;t...you can&#39;t be serious. *loud sniggering can be heard*
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-80-K Prime:** I find nothing humorous about your continued refusal to follow military protocol. How does a court martial sound to you, son? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Schmirtz:** *continues laughter for another 15 seconds* Okay, okay, I think I got that all out, //General T//██. So what, you&#39;re all anomalous poultry that watched too much Full Metal Jacket back at whatever stupid GOI lab that shit you out? Hilarious.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-80-K Prime:** Anomalous poultry? //Anomalous Poultry?!// I am General T██ of the United Chicken Corps, and I //demand// you show some respect!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Schmirtz:** Sorry, I couldn&#39;t understand you that time, it wasn&#39;t peppered with enough poorly understood military jargon. Something about the Ultra Chicken Corps?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-80-K Prime:** No, you wretched imbecile. I said the //United// Chicken Corps. They are the special unit under my command.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Schmirtz:** Why?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-80-K Prime:** Why what?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Schmirtz:** Why &#34;Chicken Corps&#34;?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-80-K Prime:** A better question would be why I am  being forced to answer such foolish questions from incompetent, insubordinate failures such as yourself.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Schmirtz:** No, a better question would be why a group of //Meleagris gallopavo//, who call themselves the &#34;Chicken Corps&#34;, are gallivanting about with toy rifles, attacking dairy cows and attempting to annex an entire barn filled with farm equipment.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-80-K Prime:** //What// did you call me?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Schmirtz:** //Meleagris gallopavo//?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-80-K Prime:** Speak English, boy.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Schmirtz:** You&#39;re...turkeys.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-80-K Prime:** This interview is over![[footnote]]But it will forever be in our hearts, General.[[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Schmirtz:** I hope you don&#39;t feel too...cooped up while you&#39;re here.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-80-K Prime:** You won&#39;t be laughing when my forces have nuked your little operation back to the stone age!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Schmirtz:** Oh that reminds me. We found your little &#34;WMD&#34; stash. It&#39;s been confiscated. And poached.
