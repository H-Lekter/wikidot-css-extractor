**Item #:** SCP-1873

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-1873 is to be kept in a standard containment locker from the 1st to the 18th and from the 22nd to the end of each month. Three days prior to the object&#39;s transportation event, it is to be moved to a cold storage chamber alongside a cadaver of the specifications shown further into this document. After the object&#39;s transportation event, its contents are to be recovered, logged and stored appropriately.

**Description:** SCP-1873 is a metal tin, of the design adopted by Crayola for its Dustless Crayons in 1905. During its initial manifestation, SCP-1873 exhibits slight damage suggestive of natural wear and tear.

SCP-1873 undergoes a repeated cycle. At midnight (local time) on the 21st of each month, SCP-1873 undergoes a transportation event and instantaneously transports itself into physical contact with the nearest human cadaver which conforms to the following specifications:

* The cadaver expired as the direct result of the violent actions of another human.
* The cadaver expired within the last seven (7) days.

In the majority (&gt;97%) of documented cases, SCP-1873 is transported in such a manner as to appear balanced atop the cadaver or placed within the cadaver&#39;s grasp. However, in rare (&lt;3%) situations, the object may appear within the cadaver in question, displacing matter from within the cadaver. Any objects contained within SCP-1873 during the transportation event disappear, and are currently presumed unrecoverable. Upon the completion of the transportation event, SCP-1873 is found to contain one or more objects, alongside a handwritten note. Notes are usually written in American English with black or blue ballpoint pen on torn pieces of lined paper, although other forms are not uncommon.
