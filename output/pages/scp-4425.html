**Item #:** SCP-4425

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** The public is to be scanned at the end of every month for any instances of SCP-4425 among civilians. Located individuals affected by SCP-4425 are to be detained and have the instance extracted from their cranium. A cover story is to be created prior to extraction.

SCP-4425-1 cans are to be stored in a standard containment locker at Site-14 and are to be appropriately labeled not for consumption.[[footnote]]SCP-4425-1 is safe for consumption, however; SCP-4425-1 is to be kept for containment purposes.[[/footnote]]

The investigation into Person of Interest 429 &#34;Chef Arkady&#34; is currently ongoing.

**Description:** SCP-4425 is the phenomena of an individual&#39;s inner cranial area spontaneously manifesting large amounts of aluminum. The aluminum will primarily grow around the subject&#39;s cerebrum, continuously growing until eventually encasing the entirety of the subject&#39;s brain. The process has been observed to lie dormant for an inexact amount of time before completely enveloping the subject&#39;s cranial area.[[footnote]]Currently, the longest amount of time taken for a subject to have completed the SCP-4425 process has been estimated to be roughly two years.[[/footnote]]

Upon complete encapsulation, the aluminum will continue conforming into the shape of a tin can[[footnote]]Hereafter referred to as SCP-4425-1[[/footnote]]. The contents of the can, contrary to the expected result of the subject&#39;s compressed cerebral tissue, typically contains a variety of seasoned meat, vegetables, etc. SCP-4425-1 has also been found to often come with a label wrapped around the can. The label typically says &#34;Chef Arkady&#39;s Canned Surprise&#34;, along with the back stating the name of the subject along with an additional word starting with the same first letter.[[footnote]]Examples of such have been found to be: &#34;Susan&#39;s Select&#34;, &#34;Fred&#39;s Favorite&#34;, &#34;Charlie&#39;s Choice&#34;, etc.[[/footnote]] SCP-4425-1 has been found to consistently be at 37Â°C upon first opening.

Individuals affected by SCP-4425 have reported experiencing mostly mild pain, yet have been observed to remain relatively unaffected throughout the entirety of SCP-4425&#39;s process. Interviews conducted upon subjects afflicted by SCP-4425 report being able to taste their personal favorite dishes.

Subjects that do not have SCP-4425-1 extracted will typically lose all bodily motions within 96 hours before SCP-4425-1 slightly protrudes from the cranium, exposing the lid.

The sapience of the affected individual is retained after SCP-4425&#39;s process is finished. Tests have discovered that SCP-4425-1 instances retain basic living functions to a primal level. Motion detections from the inside of SCP-4425-1 instances have detected minor rhythmical movements similar to a heartbeat.

**Incident Log 4425.01:** On April 11th, 2015, an advertisement was posted to popular social media websites advertising SCP-4425. The advertisement led to an anomalous URL now defunct, known as &#34;arkadymysterymeatsandvegetables.com&#34;.

The front page of the website was a video ambiguously explaining how PoI-429 creates SCP-4425, elaborating in video various details on the subject&#39;s head acting as an &#34;oven to prepare&#34; SCP-4425. At the end of the video, after following a cartoon character named &#34;Daniel&#34;, shows the headless body of Daniel give a thumbs up upon an SCP-4425-1 instance appearing on the screen stating &#34;Daniel&#39;s Delight!&#34;

The video was promptly taken down by Foundation web crawlers. There have not been any events similar to the incident at the current time.
