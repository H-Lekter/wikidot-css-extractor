**Item #:** SCP-2072

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** At least one Foundation staff member (designated Level 1-SCP-2072 or higher) must be present and armed with a standard-issue sidearm at all times. Access to SCP-2072 is restricted from the general public.

Instances of SCP-2072 are to be covered with opaque, waterproof materials at all times. If the covering on instances SCP-2072-8 to SCP-2072-22 is disturbed to the degree that the text on said instances is readable, staff replacing the coverings must be administered amnestics immediately after said replacement.

Following the next change in the Prime Ministership of Montenegro, the assigned staff member will exhume the corpse buried beneath SCP-2072-8 and collect a sufficient sample for genetic testing to ensure continued accuracy of SCP-2072.

**Description:** SCP-2072 is the former Garden of Love Pet Memorial Park, located approximately one mile south of ████████, Florida, United States. Upon the discovery of human remains beneath the northeast section of headstones in 1977, Foundation Local Mobile Task Force 352-Lamedh (“Stump Knockers”) seized control of the area to investigate. After discovering that four of the corpses located in the cemetery were genetically identical and buried under the same name, the Foundation opened a Provisional Containment Site on the premises.

The full significance of SCP-2072 was not known until June 1991, when a routine check of international political leaders’ genetic records discovered that Prime Minister of Montenegro Milo Đukanović (b. 1962, Prime Minister from 1991–98, 2003–06, 2008–10 and 2012–present [as of 2014-██-██]) was a genetic and name match for the first, third, fifth and seventh corpses located in SCP-2072, whose headstones are designated SCP-2072-1, -3, -5, and -7. The headstones and corpses have correctly reflected the holders of the office of Prime Minister of Montenegro from the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia to the present day. As SCP-2072-8 through SCP-2072-22 potentially represent future Prime Ministers of Montenegro, and SCP-2072-1, -2, -3, -5, -6, -7 and -23 contain dates of death and corpses of still-living political figures, the information in SCP-2072 is to be strictly controlled to prevent potential issues of causality.

**List of anomalous headstones located in SCP-2072:**
||~ Designation ||~ Name ||~ Subtitle ||~ Date of Birth ||~ Date of Death ||~ Notes ||
|| **SCP-2072-1** || Milo Đukanović || The Smuggler of Nikšić || 1962-2-15 || ████-██-██* || //Prime Minister on four non-consecutive occasions, and currently serving as of 2014-██-██.

Title may refer to (unproven) allegations of organized criminal activity.// ||
|| **SCP-2072-2** || Filip Vujanović || The Unguarded Man || 1954-9-1 || ████-██-██* || //Prime Minister from 1998 to 2003, currently serving as President of Montenegro as of 2014-██-██.
