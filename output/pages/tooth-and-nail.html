&gt; **Interviewed:** Agent Sarah Crowely
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. ███████
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log, ██/██/1903&gt;**






I was cold. It was Dark. I sat in my cramped space for I don&#39;t know how long. He opened the door, as light flooded the room.






&gt; **Dr. ███████:** So, Sarah. Let&#39;s talk. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Crowely:** What&#39;s this about? Was I too rough last breach, or... what?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███████:** No no, nothing like that. We just need a few things for our records.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Crowely:** O-okay. What&#39;d ya need?






He dragged me out of the room, and I screamed, like they always told me to. I had an audience now.






&gt; **Dr. ███████:** We need an account of your situation prior to joining, using your words. That&#39;s all.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Crowely:** Why? You guys know my background.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███████:** Yes, yes. To be quite honest, this is just red tape. But, you never know. Something important might come up from what you say. Never hurts to be sure.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Crowely:** Yeah, I suppose. Not much to talk about though.






He opened the door to my cage and led me to the bar room. In front of me was a man. Large, fat, drunk. He boasted wildly of what he&#39;d do to me. He laughed to my face.

He was convinced he was the one. I was afraid. I charged him.

&gt; **Dr. ███████:** Give it a shot.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Crowely:** Well. I was adopted, abducted as a baby, whatever you want to call it, by a couple of folks. E████ and T█████ Crowely. They were brothers, working together in managing some kind of fighting ring. Dunno if it was legal or not.
&gt; 
&gt; [pause]
&gt; 
&gt; Probably not. 
&gt; 
&gt; It wasn&#39;t really a good situation. They treated me more like a rabid dog than an actual kid.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███████:** I&#39;m sorry that happened. Could you go into more detail for me?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Crowely:** Well, I don&#39;t know what you want me to say.





 
I went for his legs. His weight betrayed him as I swept them aside. When he hit the floor with a thud, I latched onto his back.

The audience cheered. They wanted blood.






&gt; **Dr. ███████:** Try.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Crowely:** ... They taught me how to fight for as far back as I can remember. Called me the &#34;Savage Slant&#34; like I was part of some freak show, and threw me out to the ring to fight grown-ass men. When I was seven.
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;The child of the snow, raised from the savage north of Mongolia&#34; or some shit was their pitch. &#34;Come and see if you could take her on.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███████:** You&#39;re... Japanese though?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Crowely:** Yep. Born in Musashi, raised here. Surprised you knew that.
&gt; 
&gt; But yeah, apparently it was easier to sell a Chinese monster to a bunch of bumpkins than a Japanese one. Go figure.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███████:** Huh. So, you said that you were seven when you started fighting?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Crowely:** Yep. Well, I think. I don&#39;t really know, that&#39;s my best estimate. I coulda been eight, coulda been nine. Could even be ten. Mind you, this was... what, 15 years ago? I didn&#39;t have any concept of time back then, so it&#39;s all just this big chunk of &#34;I dunno&#34;.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███████:** Okay. We&#39;ll mark that down as &#39;unsure&#39;. So, how did you survive? You said you fought against grown men? When you were just a young girl?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Crowely:** Yeah. And I won each time.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███████:** I&#39;m sorry, what?






I wrapped my arms around his head, and went for his eyes. As I bit off his ear, he rolled on the floor, trying to get me off. I spit out a chunk of him, and went to his neck to take another. He lost when my hardened nails split his eyes.






&gt; **Agent Crowely:** I uhh... I won most of them.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███████:** H-how?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Crowely:** I don&#39;t know, I just did. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███████:** I&#39;m... having trouble understanding. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Crowely:** I just... tried really hard.






I threw him aside, and he fumbled around blindly, trying to escape. He smelled of piss. My hands were coated in red. Before I could protest, the brothers wrapped the man-catcher around my neck, and led me back to the cage.

My job was done, but I refused. I swallowed my fear. I charged.






&gt; **Dr. ███████:** Sarah, you realize how insane this sounds, right?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Crowely:** I don&#39;t know what to tell you. You have any idea what I did back then?
&gt; 
&gt; I threw them out of the ring, and broke their back. I slammed them to the ground and gouged their eyes out. I spit and chewed off bits of their face with filed teeth. It&#39;s why... It&#39;s why my hands are... it&#39;s why they&#39;re burned like this.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███████:** It&#39;s okay Sarah, you don&#39;t have to-
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Crowely:** No. You don&#39;t get to do this to me, and then expect me to stop. Every night, I was put in that fucking cage. They put me in there, grabbed my hand, and held my fingers over a candle to make my nails hard as rock. Then, they filed tooth and nail so I could fight with them. Almost. Every. Night.
&gt; 
&gt; And you wanna know the fucked up part? They made me enjoy it. Tearing off limbs was the only real &#34;interaction&#34; I had with people. My life was either &#34;cage&#34; or &#34;fight.&#34; And I did my damned best in the fighting &#39;cause... it&#39;d make my time in the cage go by easier.
&gt; 
&gt; That kind of thing... it fucks you up. It fucks you up good... Can I leave? I don&#39;t know what else you want me to tell you.






I ripped the catcher from his hands, and charged them both. I ran into one, and skewered him on the handle. I pried my head from the collar, and made short work of the other. The audience left in a hurry. I ran.

I was free.






&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Before Agent Sarah Crowely returned to duty, she applied for a position in the Site-45 therapy group, as Crowley has reported deteriorating mental health, including frequent alcohol consumption. Reassignment has been considered; however, she has remained effective in her position, and has shown signs of improvement in regards to her mental health.</textarea></pre>
