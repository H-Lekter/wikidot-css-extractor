Yay! Apparently I have collected enough page to warrant an Author Page!

I&#39;m Rigen. Well I pretty much only used that nick here, [https://www.deviantart.com/riyangendut elsewhere you might find me by the name &#34;riyangendut&#34;] which is kinda lame and unwieldy, hence I shorten it into Rigen--RIyan GENdut. As you can see by my ownership of this page, I&#39;m an author for a few articles, the bare minimum of owning an author page.

[[tabview]]
[[tab First]]
My first article was [[[SCP-3056]]], a virus that makes you sneeze fire. It&#39;s a basic X that does Y thing, and I over-detailed it with technobable, basically. Nothing interesting.
[[/tab]]
[[tab Second]]
My second surviving article was the &#34;[[[be-a-wizard-they-said|It Will Be Fun, They Said]]]&#34; that&#39;s a tale, I intended it to be formatted like internal communication bulletin for GOC operatives. I wanted to make it bizarrely normal article where the writers and readers are expected to talk about magic and centuries old magician etc with poker face. But it ended up being not really interesting. Maybe I should revisit the concept sometime.
[[/tab]]
[[tab Third]]
My third surviving article was [[[SCP-4916]]] featuring three square numbers on its title! Oh and an ancient Assyrian statue. In space. But who cares, it got three square numbers 4, 9, and 16! I also just noticed that 4916 is the first scp to ever have both Religious and Satellite tag in the same article, for some reason. Don&#39;t believe me? Ask [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/tag-search Tag Saerch.]
[[/tab]]
[[tab Fourth]]
I guess I have a fourth surviving article now, [[[SCP-5171]]] Galuh&#39;s Rhyme, about a sapient AI made by an O5 who then defected. Mentioned Tindalos for brownie points, why not. Also the PoI number 9 4 14 = IDN cuz yay nationalism.

[[collapsible show=&#34;&gt;5171 thingy&#34; hide=&#34;&lt;yeah idk&#34; hideLocation=&#34;both&#34;]]
O5-9/Galuh and Rima were childhood friends—they never //formally// dated. Rima died presumably through Galuh&#39;s fault a long time ago. As Galuh became O5-9 and something happened idk the responsibility crashed on her or she just can&#39;t fully cope with the lonely post of an O5 or she just reminded of her guilt about Rima&#39;s death, she tried to revive Rima through her AI Assistant that already bore her name (ID Rima = EN Rhyme).
But she still need Rhyme.aic to function as assistant, so she designed the interface to get Rhyme.aic to perceive the incoming messages as &#34;doctors&#34; and the meme screening process as &#34;tests&#34;. For all Rhyme.aic knows post-sapience it was Rima, finally waking up after years and years of coma after the incident that killed her in real life.

[[tab Fifth]]
Hoo Boi do I have a fifth. [[[106-takes-manhattan|106 Takes Manhattan]]] is a creck fiction contest entry, and it has MCU reference. ...and a line about Portals that apparently becomes people&#39;s sole reason for upvoting it, overshadowing the punchline for some reason.
[[/tab]]
[[tab Sixth]]
Oh hei also I have a sixth article, [[[sliver-of-serenity|Sliver of Serenity]]], a sorta kinda slice of life I wrote because I want to invest on [[*user marcelles-raynes]]&#39; character, Umar Hadid. I think it turned quite nice! He, the character I mean, seemed to be a very normal guy that just happen to stumble on things way beyond his pay grade all the time, so that&#39;s how I wrote the story.
[[/tab]]
[[tab Seventh]]
My seventh article, my magnum opus of shitpostery, the [[[SCP-6669]]], an entry to the 6kon, a sacrifice to the gates of Series 7. It&#39;s a dick-shaped megastructure.
[[/tab]]
[[tab Eighth]]
[[[rhythmic-periscope|Rhythmic Periscope]]] was a tale about Galuh/O5-9/POI-9414 from SCP-5171, describing parts of her past. With some special polygonic sauce added, from the entry I submitted for Fear in the Foundation&#39;s Tale Contest.
[[/tab]]
[[/tabview]]
Yeah I&#39;m just an all-around boring guy leave me alone &gt;_&lt;
Will update if I post new article.
