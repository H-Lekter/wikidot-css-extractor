**Item #:** 063-J

**Object Class:** Not Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-063-J is to be stored in a standard issue Foundation Aquatic Containment box. During the winter months, SCP-063-J may be checked out for experimentation with explicit permission from O5-2. Due to previous frequent containment breaches, at no point during the summer is SCP-063-J allowed to be removed from its container. 

**Description:** SCP-063-J is a surface made of poly-vinyl chloride resin with topological genus 0. When filled, SCP-063-J most closely resembles a sphere. Attempts to characterise the shape of SCP-063-J while empty, beyond trivial topological classification, are ongoing but have been described as &#34;frustrating&#34; and &#34;pointless&#34;. 

The anomalous properties of SCP-063-J manifest in two distinct effects. The first is that any individual that is made aware of SCP-063-J undergoes a compulsion to bring it to the immediate vicinity of the nearest large body of water that the individual deems &#39;clean&#39;. This effect appears to be seasonal. The second is that SCP-063-J cannot be classified as Euclid. 

Jr. Researcher Riemann was recalled from his vacation to investigate the second anomalous effect. 


||~ Prompt ||~ Test ||~ Result ||
|| Jr. Researcher Riemann was asked to fill SCP-063-J. || Inflated SCP-063-J halfway before running out of breath. Took a 5 minute rest then continued. || Success. ||
|| Jr. Researcher Riemann was asked to classify the geometry of a filled SCP-063-J.  || Spent seven hours trying to draw two parallel lines on SCP-063-J. || Failure. ||
|| Jr. Researcher Riemann was asked to draw a triangle with angles adding up to 180 degrees on SCP-063-J. || Spent four hours drawing before running out of sharpie ink. || please it&#39;s a beach ball   ||

//Ok I don&#39;t know how many times I have to explain this. Just because things are non-Euclidean doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re anomalous or spooky! So what if you can&#39;t draw parallel lines on it or sum the angles of a triangle to 180! It&#39;s a beach ball! There are so many other interesting geometries! Like hyperbolic! Or Seifert Fibers! And look, I&#39;ve been thinking about one that tracks the inner product on an arbitrary smooth manifold and//

**Update:** Jr. Researcher Riemann&#39;s access to SCP-063-J has been revoked, because something is wrong with him. Jr. Researcher Riemann is also no longer allowed to talk about esoteric geometries.</textarea></pre>
