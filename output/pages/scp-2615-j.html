**Item #:** SCP-2615-J

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** All SCP-2615-J instances are to be contained in Standard Micro-Humanoid containment cells, which are then to be stored at Site-17. SCP-2615-J instances are to be fed thrice daily.

**Description:** SCP-2615-J is a species of sapient humanoids which measure fifteen centimeters tall on average. All SCP-2615-J instances possess wings of varying appearance, though the wings universally match the appearance of the wings of various species of //Lepidoptera//. SCP-2615-J instances can use these wings to achieve airborne locomotion. SCP-2615-J instances are luminescent, though the light produced generates no heat and has no clear biological or chemical basis.

SCP-2615-J instances are capable of limited reality warping, with most of their effects only affecting natural phenomena. Phenomena effected by SCP-2615-J include weather patterns, atmospheric temperature and pressure, animal behavior, and plant growth.

**Addendum:** Interview with SCP-2615-J instance #28.

&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-2615-J #28
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Tamlin
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tamlin:** #28, you are aware that several aspects of your physiology are not scientifically possible, correct? Would you care to explain how they work?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2615-J #28:** Ah, I get it. You&#39;re gonna try the old &#34;I don&#39;t believe in fairies&#34; trick to try and get rid of us. It&#39;s not gonna work, you know, we moved away from existentialism a while back.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tamlin:** I&#39;m not sure that you understood the question. For example, you weigh, what? 35 grams? Your wings shouldn&#39;t be able to support you in flight.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2615-J #28:** It&#39;s magic.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tamlin:** The glow is another thing. There&#39;s no biological or chemical reason that you should be glowing.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2615-J #28:** Again, magic.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tamlin:** But what about-
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2615-J #28:** MAGIC! IT&#39;S ALL FREAKIN&#39; MAGIC YOU IDIOT! WHY CAN&#39;T YOU GET THAT THROUGH YOUR THICK SKULL?! //[At this point, SCP-2615-J #28&#39;s speech degrades into a set of growls, grunts, screams, expletives, and yet to be translated language.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tamlin:** I think we&#39;re done here.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log**&gt;

**Note:**
&gt; Hi, sorry about that. Odds are that you&#39;re new to the Foundation and got linked to this page as a joke. I&#39;ll go ahead and tell you now that anything and everything with a &#34;[http://www.scp-wiki.net/joke-scps -J]&#34; in the name is just an in-joke that someone made up (they tend to help boost morale). I normally wouldn&#39;t put this here, but I just got asked for the fifth time in a week what the &#34;larger implications of SCP-2615-J&#39;s comments&#34; are. There are no &#34;larger implications&#34;. -Js aren&#39;t real. Move along and go read [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-779 SCP-779] or something. -//Researcher Walker//
&gt; 
&gt; P.S. I apologize if the humor wasn&#39;t readily apparent. It was originally created to get a laugh out of people who were there for the Site-17 picnic of &#39;96. The only reason I can think of that we still have it is because some of the guys like getting a rise out of the newbies.
