Items of a specific SCP-5110 product designated further as SCP-5110-A through SCP-5110-D

An abridiged description of each SCP-5110 product and its observed effects are available below:


||~ Designation ||~ Name on Packaging ||~ Description||
|| SCP-5110-A || PURE BERRIES || SCP-5110-A appears to be a container of assorted berries with packaging typical of the &#39;PURE FOODS&#39; brand. After consumption, SCP-5110-A manifests large quantities of rotting berries inside of the digestive system of the consumer.||
|| SCP-5110-B || PURE SODA || SCP-5110-B resembles a soda can used by brands such as Coca-Cola or Pepsi, with packaging typical of the &#39;PURE FOODS&#39; brand. SCP-5110-B&#39;s contents are carbonated mineral water. After consumption, multiple glass 237ml bottles form in the digestive system of the consumer, often shattering from pressure. ||
|| SCP-5110-C || PURE WORMS || The packaging contains multiple multi-flavored gummy candies in the shape of worms. Following ingestion, entities resembling //Eunice aphroditois// appear inside of the subject&#39;s digestive system. These entities, when removed, appear colored or dyed to resemble the candies  in SCP-5110-C.
