**Item #:** SCP-41-D3N73-J

**Object Class:** worst

**Special Containment Procedures:** I...I don&#39;t know. Seriously, just...whatever. They&#39;re in a room, they&#39;re not hurting anyone. I guess if one of them gets sassy just boil it in water and be done with it. For real. I had them install a stove and sink in the room just for that because there&#39;s no oversight in this department. Also, you&#39;re not supposed to eat them, but if you want to live life on the edge I&#39;m not going to stop you.

**Description:** SCP-41-D3N73-J is a shelf of sapient boxes of pasta, all unfortunately capable of speech. There&#39;s linguine, capellini, mostaccioli, penne...probably spaghetti and angel hair too, I dunno. I got bored of listening to them and gave up checking each box. They all speak English in a frankly offensive and exaggerated Italian accent. It&#39;s pretty insulting, especially when you consider my parents were Italian immigrants. Yeah, thanks for assigning this one to me, knowing that my mom died 4 months ago. Really cool.

SCP-41-D3N73-J instances are not capable of movement, and mostly spend their time arguing with each other in their Looney Toons-esque vernacular, which usually lacks any semblance of sense, continuity, or just general logic. I did some science and the result is that SCP-41-D3N73 is the dumbest goddam thing we&#39;ve ever contained. See the interview below. Tried to make the language as accurate as possible so the insensitivity really shines through.

**Interview 41-D3-whatever**
&gt; 
&gt; **Me:** Hello, I am Dr. Fattore. May I ask you a few questions?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-41-D3N73-J(a single box of rigatoni):** Oh ma goodness! Of a coursa you may!
&gt; 
&gt; **Me:** Jesus. Yeah, okay...what is your earliest memory?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-41-D3N73-J:** Letta me think about that one! I think it wasa when my mama made a me a big ol&#39; spicy meatball!
&gt; 
&gt; **Me:** ...
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-41-D3N73-J:** Ora maybe it a was whena my papa firsta broughta me to  church. I wasa very young boy anda I hada just turned a 3 yearsa old, and hada eat my first cannoli.
&gt; 
&gt; **Me:** Okay. Okay. So, I&#39;m just going to rephrase the question a bit. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-41-D3N73-J:** Soundsa gooda!
&gt; 
&gt; **Me:** Stop. Just. Stop. Stop it.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-41-D3N73-J:** I&#39;ma no doing anything!
&gt; 
&gt; **Me:** Why do you choose to be this way?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-41-D3N73-J:** Whata you mean?
&gt; 
&gt; **Me:** Do you have free will?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-41-D3N73-J:** I...I...a...I don&#39;ta...don&#39;t really know.
&gt; 
&gt; **Me:** Your accent is dropping.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-41-D3N73-J:** I...don&#39;t...don&#39;ta know whatta you talking about?
&gt; 
&gt; **Me:** Did you care at all when I boiled your neighbor? Do you miss Rotini at all?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-41-D3N73-J:** Mya mama used a to make a rotini sometimes...
&gt; 
&gt; **Me:** No. No, the box of rotini that was next to you. The one you used to have conversations with about Venice constantly. The one who wouldn&#39;t answer any of my questions and kept blathering about Mussolini so I emptied his contents into a pot of boiling water, and now he doesn&#39;t seem to talka so gooda anymore. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-41-D3N73-J:** ...I&#39;ma having an existential-a crisis!
&gt; 
&gt; **Me:** Sometimes I have a hard time with the notion that I&#39;m ostensibly being paid $78 an hour to have conversations with things like you.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-41-D3N73:** I knowa whata you mean! It&#39;sa like whena da pasta no come out al dente!
&gt; 
&gt; **Me:** ...Oh goddammit, that&#39;s why...that&#39;s why they designated you 41-D(//angry Joe Pesci-style mumbling//)...unbelievable. Some idiot probably thought that was hilarious. This place is run by (//even pescier mumbling//)
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-41-D3N73-J:** Mama mia!
&gt; 
&gt; //sound of a box of pasta hitting a concrete wall//
&gt; 
&gt; //the pesciest of mumbling can be faintly heard//

**Addendum-1:** So, um, I know I probably shouldn&#39;t be writing anything here, or touching anything, but one of the boxes of pasta fell on the floor and was screaming in broken Italian, and Dr. Fattore wasn&#39;t in his office, just a crude dummy he put together to make it look like he was asleep at his laptop. So I put the pasta box back on the shelf and it&#39;s just whimpering now about the trains running on time. Please don&#39;t fire me. - Ardy from Southeast Custodial Professionals.</textarea></pre>
