**Item #:** SCP-4727

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Item is kept in a secure locker at Site-73. Testing requires permission from current research head. Repeat experimentation with the same subject requires additional Ethics Committee approval.

**Description:** SCP-4727 is a Star Model BM pistol manufactured in 1985. Falling asleep while holding the pistol&#39;s grip induces dreams of a consistent nature involving chasing down, cornering, and killing some kind of person or creature. Should the actions undertaken in the dream be successful, the dreamer will awake with a metal briefcase in their other hand.

The briefcase invariably contains an item of value to the pistol&#39;s user. It cannot be opened by anyone other than the user, whose name will be inscribed on the briefcase&#39;s top, followed by the phrase &#34;Chase your dreams.&#34;

The pistol&#39;s anomalous effect can only be triggered once. Attempting to trigger this effect more than once is highly disrecommended.

**Appendix A:** Object history

||~ User ||~ Dream experienced ||~ Object obtained ||~ Remarks ||
|| Antonio Inez, 18-year-old entrepreneur in El Paso, TX. || Unknown || (Theorised) An electronic storage device containing the source code for a machine-learning-based food delivery service. || Inez rose to prominence as a notorious &#34;one-man startup&#34; following the release of his company&#39;s trademark app, Gobblr. He was later found dead in his house following what appeared to be a violent break-in. The pistol, along with an empty briefcase, was recovered from his possession by officers of the El Paso PD. ||
|| Ronald Rogers, 26-year-old police detective in El Paso, TX.|| In a session with his therapist on 17/05/2017, Rogers once reported a dream in which he chased down a human-sized police corporal badge, cornering it in a dark alley and brutally beating it with his bare hands. [[footnote]]This was noted by his therapist as an improvement over Roger&#39;s usual dreams of chasing down and beating up unarmed Hispanic children.  [[/footnote]] || (Theorised) A note detailing plans to break into and burgle the home of Antonio Inez, bearing the fingerprints of Cornelius Lin, the CEO of another El Paso-based food-delivery startup. || Rogers was later credited as providing the vital evidence needed to arrest Lin, receiving promotion to police corporal for his efforts. ||
|| Krystelle-Lynn &#34;Chastity&#34; Thomas, 20-year-old sex worker in El Paso, TX. || Thomas&#39; extensive online blog detailing her experiences with various mind-altering substances contains a description of a dream dated 20/05/2017, in which she wakes up in the body of a &#34;bold, black man&#34; who follows a delivery boy into an abandoned warehouse, then shoots him with a shotgun. || The wallet of her alleged lover, police corporal Ronald Rogers, containing $27.40 in cash, a driver&#39;s license, and a strip of paper with a phone number written on it in lipstick. || On the night of 20/05/2017, Thomas broke into the home of police corporal Ronald Rogers and killed him with two shots to the head using SCP-4727&#39;s non-anomalous pistol function. Police officers responding to the scene were fired upon by Thomas, who managed to wound an officer before being fatally shot in the chest. ||

**Appendix B:** Foundation investigation

The item came to the attention of the Foundation when the three briefcases of identical make were found at the residences of Antonio Inez, Ronald Rogers, and Krystelle-Lynn Thomas. Embedded Foundation agents clandestinely secured the item after its significance was suspected. Its anomalous properties were confirmed during testing when experimental subject D-961006 produced a briefcase with her name on it, containing one Foundation standard-issue [REDACTED]. The opening was sealed by on-site technicians and D-961006 was terminated by site security. Item was designated SCP-4727 and allocated further resources for testing.
