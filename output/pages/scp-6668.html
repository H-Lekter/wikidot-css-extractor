**Item #:** SCP-6668

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6668&#39;s cell walls are to be lined with slits adjacent to an additional observation room. Observational slits should be no larger than 3in x 1ft and be cleared of any obstructions. No personnel can enter or leave SCP-6668&#39;s cell until visual confirmation of SCP-6668&#39;s location is given. Any personnel who&#39;ve come in contact with substance CE-66 should be isolated and treated with ███████ and █████ ███████ until effects of CE-66 are no longer present.

**Description:** SCP-6668 is a humanoid approximately 2.94m tall. SCP-6668&#39;s skin lacks any hair or pores and has slight pigmentation of pink. Subject&#39;s nails and teeth are exaggerated in size and resemble that of the Dromaeosaurid family&#39;s claws and fangs. Subject&#39;s eyes appear to have excessive amounts of mydriasis resulting in little to none Sclera being visible. SCP-6668 appears to require zero to little nutritional value, hunting and consuming prey purely for sport.

SCP-6668&#39;s body is lined with a thin layer of a mucus like substance being classified as CE-66 which is excreted through unknown means. CE-66 contains incognizance properties preventing SCP-6668 from being observed through any methods other than direct eye contact. Methods proven ineffective include cameras, photos, mirrors, windows, thermal scans, sonar scans, and x-rays. When someone other than SCP-6668 comes in contact with CE-66, it slowly begins seeping into their skin. Once CE-66 has fully soaked into the inflicted person, they will begin to retain the properties of SCP-6668. This will also affect any previous observations of the person i.e. absent in past photos or videos.

SCP-6668 is highly aggressive towards --people-- foundation staff and is estimated to be capable of speeds around 40km/h. SCP-6668&#39;s preferred method of attack is laceration around the victim&#39;s jugular or limb joints. On occasion SCP-6668 has been seen regurgitating a mixture of CE-66, urushiol, and human flesh into a spitball which has been used to obscure view of SCP-6668. Standard facility tranquilizer darts are affective against SCP-6668 and should be used when transporting or collecting samples of CE-66 from SCP-6668.

**Addendum 6668-1:** //Recovery//

On █/██/2020, SCP-6668 was discovered in ██████████, Utah, when local officers responded to a noise complaint. Upon arrival, the bodies of ████ and ███████ █████ were discovered who had died from lacerations around the torso and ████&#39;s neck had been dislocated. Officer ████ discovered the █ year old daughter of ███████, who was found curled in the corner of her room. Officer ████  was then reportedly attacked by a &#39;demon&#39; according to a police report given by officer ███████, resulting in the dispatch of Mobile Task Force Epsilon-6.
//Note: Officer ███████ was wearing glasses during the time of the incident.//

A journal documenting the daughter&#39;s time with SCP-6668 was found and recovered alongside 
SCP-6668. Please note the journal was considerably damaged upon recovery and the following transcript reads the eligible contents of the journal.

**Addendum 6668-2:** //Experiment logs involving CE-66//

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
__**Experiment 6668-CE-E-1**__

**Date:** ██/██/2020

**Procedure:** Subject D-39475 is to apply 1 Tablespoon of CE-66 to their right forearm and be observed through a two way mirror.

**Results:** Subject became unobservable approximately 16 seconds after CE-66 was fully applied. 

Request to treat D-39475 (denied).
[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
__**Experiment 6668-CE-E-2**__

**Date:** █/██/2021

**Procedure:** Subject D-83746 is to wear a layer of protective clothing and apply 1 Tablespoon of CE-66 to their right forearm and be observed through a two way mirror.

**Results:** CE-66 soaked through subject&#39;s protective layer then into subject&#39;s skin. Subject became unobservable approximately 1 minute 47 seconds after CE-66 was fully applied. 

Request to treat D-83746 (approved).
[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
__**Experiment 6668-CE-E-3**__

**Date:** █/█/2021

**Procedure:** Subject D-80085 is to be interviewed and recorded participating in daily tasks a week prior to CE-66 experiment. Subject D-80085 is to apply 1 Tablespoon of CE-66 to their right forearm and be observed through a two way mirror.

**Results:** Subject became unobservable approximately 14 seconds after CE-66 was fully applied. Upon inspection of footage of D-80085, subject was absent in all recorded data. Objects subject interacted with became altered in footage. Examples include:
* Papers moved by D-80085 remained in it&#39;s original resting position.
* Doors opened by D-80085 remained closed.
* Food given to D-80085 never appearing in footage.

Request to treat D-80085 (denied).

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
__**Experiment 6668-CE-E-4**__

**Date:** █/██/2021

**Procedure:** Subject D-54029 is to dip their right forearm into a container of CE-66 for 10 seconds and be observed through a two way mirror.

**Results:** Subject became unobservable approximately 1.6 seconds after CE-66 was fully applied. Subject D-54029 disobeyed directions stating &#34;This is a joke&#34; before proceeding to consume 247 milliliters of CE-66 before guards could intervene and restrain D-54029. 

Request to treat D-54029 (approved).
//Note: Normal treatment failed. Foundation staff continued excessive treatment until D-54029 died due to █████████ ████████.//
[[/div]]

**Addendum 6668-3:** //Incident-6668-1//

On █/██/2021, due to ████████ ███████████ ████████, SCP-6668 breached containment. During the containment breach, SCP-6668 hunted and killed two D-class personnel involved in CE-66 experiments before being located and recaptured. SCP-6668 was unusually compliant with foundation guards resulting in no further deaths.

█ hours after the incident, SCP-6668 agreed to be questioned by Dr. █████. The following is an audio log of the interview conducted by Dr. █████.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Interviewed:** SCP-6668
**Interviewer:** Dr. █████

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**Dr. █████:** How are you feeling?

**SCP-6668:** Better.

**Dr. █████:** Why do you feel better?

**SCP-6668:** I saved them.

**Dr. █████:** Who are you referring to?

**SCP-6668:** Those men.

**Dr. █████:** Are you referring to the personnel you killed?

**SCP-6668:** I rescued them.

**Dr. █████:** You, ripped their throats out.

**SCP-6668:** To save them, from a worse fate.

**Dr. █████:** What fate did you save them from?

**SCP-6668:** True, death.

**Dr. █████:** I don&#39;t think you understand what you did-

**SCP-6668:** No, Doctor. You don&#39;t understand what you were doing to those people. I was fine, being alone in this hell. But you had to drag me to this place and make others join me. I just wanted to disappear.

[Dr. █████ is confirmed to be writing on a clipboard for 12 seconds]

**Dr. █████:** Thank you for your cooperation.

**&lt;End Log&gt;**
