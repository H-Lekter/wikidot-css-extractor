**Item #**: SCP-5173

**Object Class**: --Keter-- Neutralised

**Special Containment Procedures**: SCP-5173 has been neutralised and no further Containment Procedures are required.
[[collapsible show=&#34; + Show Prior Special Containment Procedures&#34; hide=&#34; - Close Prior Special Containment Procedures&#34;]]
Foundation OrbSat PERIHELION is to monitor the region of space that SCP-5173 occupies. Any transmissions emitted from SCP-5173 are to be intercepted by the Foundation. 

In the event that SCP-5173 becomes known to non-Foundation personnel, MTF Gamma-5 (&#34;Red Herrings&#34;) are to be deployed, and given the authority to utilise any fabricated cover story that they deem necessary to obfuscate the existence of SCP-5173.

In the case of an emergence event, the Foundation are to declare an Amida-class situation entailing an attempt to neutralise the anomaly using all weaponry capable of reaching SCP-5173.

**Description**: SCP-5173 refers to a gravitational singularity orbiting at the edge of the Oort cloud.

SCP-5173 was detected as suddenly materialising within the solar system on the 4th July 2019 at 22:11 and was immediately sighted by Foundation OrbSat PERIHELION. 

At the time, SCP-5173 appeared to be the nova of a hereto unknown object with a mass of 0.08M⊙.[[footnote]]M⊙ is a standard unit of mass in astronomy, equal to approximately 2×10³⁰ kg.[[/footnote]] It was classified &#34;Keter&#34;, due to its potentially uncontainable nature.

In addition, the Foundation intercepted a long-range radio wave isolated from NASA&#39;s DSN.[[footnote]]The Deep Space Network, a series of radio antenna intended to detect low-energy radio waves from deep space.[[/footnote]] This long-range radio wave was detected on the 4th July 2019 at 22:02 but the Foundation was not immediately made aware of the discovery.

This long-range radio wave was transformed into an audio signal by Foundation staff and its contents are transcribed below in English:

Observation of SCP-5173 continued unabated for a further year. During this time, the object decayed in luminosity and size. On the 5th July 2020, a gravity wave was detected emanating from SCP-5173 indicating that the object had decayed and collapsed. 

SCP-5173 was declared neutralised to reflect the nature of this discovery.

**Addendum 5173.1**:

On 5th July 2020, it was discovered by the Deep Space Satellite Relay that the radio transmission intercepted by the Foundation had also been broadcast to another location. It was broadcast directly towards the constellation of Canis Minor, more specifically, the star Procyon.

It is expected that the radio transmission will reach Procyon by late 2031.

Foundation OrbSat PERIHELION has been redirected and its mission profile has been updated to continually monitor the Procyon stellar system for any evidence of biosignatures, radio transmissions, and other evidence of sentient life.
