**Item #:** SCP-010-J

**Object Class:** Completely harmless, stop asking

**Special Containment Procedures:** No containment procedures are necessary, as SCP-010-J is not a threat and nothing to worry about. SCP-010-J is to be peacefully observed from Area-399, which has been designated a no-panicking zone under penalty of termination.

Hell, we don&#39;t even know what it is, nor do we need to, but we know for certain that it isn&#39;t going to hurt anyone, and talking about it is a total waste of time! Oh, well, I guess you&#39;ll have to look at some other article that isn&#39;t this one. Now.
[[include component:image-block

    caption=You are 500 times more likely to be shot execution-style in a back alley by this newt than be harmed by SCP-010-J. That&#39;s science.
]]
**Description:** SCP-010-J is an unimportant entity that is //not// going to turn anyone&#39;s iteration of reality into a lifeless blob of primordial sludge. It is not cognitohazardous, not infohazardous, non-toxic, and does not even technically exist. 

Contrary to dangerous and libelous rumors, SCP-010-J is not made of black holes, as that would mean we&#39;d already be dead, right? Right?! I didn&#39;t think so. You can stop worrying about it being made of black holes. //I said stop!//

    caption=Look at the fuzzy kitty! He&#39;s not worried! Why should you worry? Haha! Hahahaha! HAAHAAAAHAHAAA--
]]
**Addendum:** A request has been sent to O5 command to quell any fears people have about SCP-010-J and the giant [DATA EXPUNGED] that it //may or may not// have in its tendrils, as it&#39;s not going to hurt you and frankly it wishes we would all leave it alone. 

Unfortunately, O5 command has responded by beginning summary terminations of all staff at Area-399 for //entirely unrelated// reasons. Maybe they just like shooting people! Well, they won&#39;t shoot you, so you have nothing to worry about, so go ahead and have a nice, safe day like the rest of us!</textarea></pre>
