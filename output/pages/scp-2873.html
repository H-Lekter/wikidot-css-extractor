**Item #:** SCP-2873

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** All recovered SCP-2873 instances should be disassembled and stored in high security storage at Site-79. Recovered Anderson Robotics delivery orders for SCP-2873 instances should be traced and surviving instances recovered. All active SCP-2873 components should be put into standby mode until further notice.

Testing with SCP-2873 is strictly prohibited. Rehabilitation of active components pending approval.

**Description:** SCP-2873 refers to a missile guidance assembly manufactured by Anderson Robotics, apparently a derivative work of [[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2897 REDACTED]] resulting in a less effective but highly miniaturized artificial intelligence system-on-a-chip. Individual SCP-2873 instances possess, on average, the intelligence level and personal development of adolescents.

Based on recovered Anderson Robotics research materials and operation manuals, SCP-2873 instances exist in a simulation of education and indoctrination into nationalism, militarism, jingoism and self-sacrifice for a generalized, non-existent state. Out of the factory, SCP-2873 instances have simulated this pseudo-reality for fourteen years.

Anderson Robotics testing resulted shows that the usage of these SCP-2873 chips as guidance units increased hit ratios by ███% while only slightly reducing overall reliability. However, operations manuals also discourage the use of SCP-2873 with chemical, biological, or radiological warheads due to this decreased reliability.

&gt; **Foreword:** Raw process dump recovery established on via standard system troubleshooting per Anderson Robotics product manual. Information parsed via [DATA EXPUNGED] - the following statements can be best described as the &#39;thoughts&#39; of the AI prior to and during the launch sequence. SCP-2873 instance in this case attached to █████████ anti-ship missile.
