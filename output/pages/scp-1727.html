**Item #:** SCP-1727

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1727 is to be contained in a high-capacity containment vault, located in [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-77| Site-77]]]&#39;s Safe SCP wing. A pool large enough to encompass the mass of vehicles used in testing is to be kept in this containment chamber, being maintained daily by Foundation personnel. The area SCP-1727 was discovered in has been purchased by Foundation front organizations, with all nearby buildings being demolished. 

**Description:** SCP-1727 is a ███ ███████ brand portable car wash, manufactured in 1999. The exterior is painted blue, with a logo for the non-existent &#34;CRSHCRS[[footnote]]Denoting a possible connection with [[[SCP-1894]]][[/footnote]] Corporation&#34; printed on the sides. SCP-1727&#39;s interior components match those found in other ███ ███████ brand portable car washes. 

When a vehicle enters SCP-1727, it will be cleaned normally by SCP-1727&#39;s components. The driver can select from several options to change the way their vehicle will be cleaned. A button at the bottom is labeled &#34;Open-Sub cleaning&#34;, which costs twice as much as the other options. If the last option is selected, cleaning instruments will hold the vehicle in place, and the roof portion of SCP-1727 will open via an unknown mechanism. Following this, the vehicle will be catapulted upward, at an angle. SCP-1727 will then dispense a receipt with a personalized message.

&gt; A quick job done well-Just as the customer likes it.

&gt; High up and all clean, buffed by fluffy clouds.

&gt; That was close. But exciting!

Vehicles launched by SCP-1727 will continue being propelled through the air until they pass a source of water large enough to enclose them. Note that these vehicles do not follow a normal arc, but will continue moving through the air at the same speed until a suitable water source is located. These can be locations such as oceans, lakes, rivers, aquifers, or bodies such as swimming pools, fish tanks, and clouds. Using [[[SCP-1872]]] will not affect a vehicle&#39;s trajectory or velocity. After reaching their destinations, vehicles will decelerate normally. Drivers do not typically survive impact. 

SCP-1727 was discovered after reports of vehicles hurtling through clouds were reported by passengers on a civilian aircraft. Initially classified as an Extranormal Event, further investigation was conducted after reports of a vehicle impacting the ███████ military testing course reached Foundation assets in the U.S army. A cover story regarding local pranksters was disseminated, with SCP-1727 being classified as Safe on 11/17/2000.


**Incident 1727-1:** During testing on 11/16/2002, a vehicle launched by SCP-1727 was not found. No report matching SCP-1727&#39;s effect have been found, and as of 4/14/2009 has not reappeared. The receipt message printed by SCP-1727 has been made available in this report.

&gt; = Oops.
