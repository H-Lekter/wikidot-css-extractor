**Special Containment Procedures:**  Containment of SCP-5814 is impossible and unnecessary. SCP-5814&#39;s phenomenon is unlikely to cause any significant threats to carbon-based organisms for the foreseeable future, but it is expected that a mass extinction of carbon-based life caused by the item will occur as the scale of time is extrapolated to an order of magnitude of millions of years. 

Observation of the anomalous effect of SCP-5814 is to be conducted with the following procedure.

[[collapsible show=&#34; + Technical details&#34; hide=&#34;- Hide technical details&#34;]]

With a period of 72 hours, the speed of light in standard 0.020 mol/L potassium hydrogen phthalate solution is to be measured under 298.15K and 101.325kPa.[[footnote]]Common room temperature (25.00 °C; 77.00 °F) and atmospheric pressure.[[/footnote]] The solution dielectric constant obtained is then used for confirming Freking&#39;s Law (see below) by substituting the measured value into the equation. This result should be directly reported to the Overseer council if a nonnegligible deviation from the Freking&#39;s Law is found in more than 10 consecutive measurements.

[[/collapsible]]

**Description:** SCP-5814 is an anomalous phenomenon that has an area of influence across multiple clusters within the Laniakea supercluster[[footnote]]The supercluster where the Milky Way is located.[[/footnote]]. 

It is confirmed that the effect of SCP-5814 does not lead to any change in the physical laws in the affected region but will affect the behavior of all chemical reactions by changing the strength of interaction between atoms and molecules, especially sharply decreasing the activation energy[[footnote]]The energy needed to initiate a chemical reaction. Generally speaking, the energy of the reaction system will firstly increase to reach a maximum value (called the &#34;energy barrier&#34;) and then drop back to form the products with lower energy. The whole process is similar to a “climbing over a mountain to reach a plain” process. The energy needed for overcoming the barrier is called activation energy。[[/footnote]] of different reactions involving electric charge, making systems that are thermodynamically unstable but dynamically stable reach the status of thermal equilibrium rapidly. Considering that non-equilibrium processes play essential roles in the sustaining of life, progression of SCP-5814 over time may cause a CC-Class &#34;Collapse of Chemistry&#34; scenario, resulting in that the chemistry relying on carbon element will no longer provide the conditions suitable for creating life.

Although the potentially destructive effect of SCP-5814 has never been directly observed, current studies have revealed that SCP-5814 may have initiated several cases of CC-Class Scenario in the past, resulting in the current universe ecology. Based on current observations, SCP-5814 only has limited negative impacts on carbon-based living systems for the time being, but its effect will be unignorable as the time scale is prolonged to an order of magnitude of millions of years.

Effects of SCP-5814 within its range of influence are embodied by a specific medium, SCP-5814-A. SCP-5814-A behaves like an ideal gas physically and is speculated to be composed of a kind of previously unknown boson[[footnote]]A class of particles. The main feature of these particles is that they have integer spin.[[/footnote]]. Particles that constituted SCP-5814-A are electrically neutral, but have a certain degree of electric susceptibility, and have shown characteristics of an induced dipole when interacting with electric charges, behaving similarly to a dielectric material. SCP-5814-A can penetrate through all known solids, liquids, and gases spatially, but its effects are determined to be of atomic scale. For interactions of subatomic scale, SCP-5814-A will not cause any obvious effects. 

The main anomalous property of SCP-5814-A is that SCP-5814-A&#39;s electric susceptibility will increase in time. As SCP-5814-A can penetrate through all known matters, its change in electric susceptibility will affect the polarity of nearby matter, macroscopically causing polar materials to increase in dielectric constant. It is proved that the rate of change in electric susceptibility follows the equation of ████████. The current value of SCP-5814-A&#39;s electric susceptibility is ████ based on theoretical computation.

**Addendum I.** The discovery of SCP-5814

In the year 1972, Foundation researcher Dr. Arnold Freking discovered a change in the measured speed of light in the air while checking earlier records of measurements of the speed of light. Though very insignificant, the measured speed of light in air is found to have decreased in the recent 100 years. This effect has shown to be more observable in water, in which the speed of light has decreased by ██.██% in the recent 100 years. Observations on other physical constants, including measurements of the rate of nuclear reactions, have shown that speed of light in the vacuum had never changed. Analysis based on observation results, Hubble&#39;s law[[footnote]]A law used for determination of the moving speed of galaxies.[[/footnote]], and virial theorem[[footnote]]A physical law describing the relation between potential energy and kinetic energy of a system. The existence of unobservable substances (such as dark matter) could be postulated from the unusual values obtained by Hubble&#39;s law and virial theorem.[[/footnote]] has shown that an unknown medium is distributed across some regions of the Laniakea Supercluster. Such medium itself has a certain degree of electric susceptibility, and causes the increase of dielectric constant of polar substances such as water when interacting with them.

Analysis based on the observed value showed that, under the anomalous effect of SCP-5814-A, the relation of the speed of light observed in different media with time is generally in accordance with the equation c=c,,0,,×(b,,F,,+k,,F,,t)^^-1/2^^, which was then called Freking&#39;s law. Based on this result, it could be postulated that SCP-5814-A will cause the relative dielectric constant of matter to change linearly with time. Dr. Freking deems such phenomenon enough to make SCP-5814 a kind of anomaly. He reported his observation result to the Physics and Mathematics Research Institution of the Foundation (SCP-PMRI), who then defined the item on ██/█/1980 based on the phenomenon.

**Addendum II.** Extract of the research report about SCP-5814, submitted to the Overseer Council by PMRI (██/██/2000)

[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5814/EA|align=center|caption=Under the effect of SCP-5814, the activation energy of some reactions will be significantly lowered, which allows the corresponding reactions to process under a relatively low temperature.]]

&gt;  ……By applying computational methods, we have proven that the cumulated impact of SCP-5814 has greatly changed the regular pattern of chemical reactions within its affected region in the Laniakea supercluster, especially those reactions involving heavy elements and/or driven by electrostatic interaction.
&gt; @@@@
&gt; The main observable effect of SCP-5814 is to enlarge the dielectric constant of solvents, which is, to a great extent, destructive to most biochemical reactions. A great example to illustrate the impact of the item is the stability of all-silicon analogs of biochemical molecules in water. Despite the fact that silicon dioxide is thermodynamically more stable than the aqueous solution of these delicate molecules at any time, at 8 billion years ago, the formation of silicon dioxide by these molecules and water would require significantly higher activation energy. As a result, they could exist stably in aqueous environments even under room temperature.
&gt; @@@@
&gt; Through theoretical calculation, we found that the chemistry of silicon 8 billion years ago may be as diverse and stable as the chemistry of carbon today. Actually, it was even possible to design a whole set of stable silicon-based life-forming molecules. We could obtain silicon homologs of amino acids, sugars, and nucleotides. They are fully capable of aggregating together and forming silicon-based life which is similar to the carbon-based life we now have.
&gt; @@@@
&gt; Just like all of us have known,  as one of the most abundant matters in the universe, water would be the most appropriate choice of functioning as the solvent of life. If we keep pushing back in time, we may discover more varieties of life based on different chemical systems. Phosphorus, sulfur, even metals. Tolerance of these systems towards water will all be significantly increased, which will greatly increase the possibility of evolving life.
&gt; @@@@
&gt; Based on such discovery, we believe that we have already reached the conclusion about the potential hazard of SCP-5814. Throughout the 8 billion years, the dielectric constant of water has already increased significantly due to the effect of SCP-5814. SCP-5814 itself will lower the tolerance of specific compounds towards water, leading to rapid hydrolytic destruction[[footnote]]Collapse of structure of molecules due to their reaction with water.[[/footnote]] of the potential life-forming molecules, and finally reach the dead state of thermodynamic equilibrium.
&gt; @@@@
&gt; This fact means, there will definitely be a doomsday for us, similar to what silicon-based life have gone through billions of years ago. We will become the nitrogen, carbon dioxide and water in Earth&#39;s atmosphere, become part of this planet&#39;s &#34;natural environment&#34;, and hand over the baton of life onto next kind of life form. 
&gt; @@@@
&gt; Machanilization or digitalization of our body may support the existence of humanity as a species for a short period of time, but these methods still rely on substances, which are expected to be destroyed by water given that the effect of SCP-5814 strengthens as time passed, we now believe that it will still be vulnerable towards SCP-5814 and thus can hardly be regarded as a solution. 
&gt; @@@@
&gt; We admit that we will finally meet the end of all life even without the existence of SCP-5814, but it will definitely accelerate this process. Due to its special properties, we currently have a pessimistic view that we do not have any means to defend against the effects of SCP-5814, just as how we cannot resist the second law of thermodynamics.

**Addendum III.**  Archaeological exploration memo of Foundation in Greenland Region

In year 1986, giant groups of supracrustal rock pillars with extraordinary structures were discovered under the tundra layer in Greenland regions while quarrying. Such rock pillars may be one of the most ancient landscapes to have existed on the Earth, approximated to have existed over 3.8 billion years, but internally consisting of excavation marks unexplainable by natural phenomenons.

Site-██ has acquired the ownership of the land on █/█/1986, and has quickly cordoned off surrounding regions. Exhumation operation had completed on █/█/1990.

[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5814/800px-Uummannaq-mountain-southeastern-pillar-trabants.jpg|align=center|caption=Part of rock pillars in Greenland Region after completion of exhumation.]]

During 1991~2013, MTF-█-██ have carried out multiple explorations to the area and more clues about the previous effect of SCP-5814 on the Earth was revealed. Some contents of the exploration activities are summarized in the extract of the related report shown below.

&gt;  ……These ancient structures of rock pillars are quite unusual. They were preserved very well by the surface tundra, which allowed us to investigate some structural details even after billions of years.
&gt; @@@@
&gt; We have discovered some complicated, intercrossing caves within these pillars, and the formation of some cave structures is unable to be explained by any of the known natural causes. Apparently, these special cave-like structures may have specific functions in the past, just like an ancient city built by prehistoric civilizations.
&gt; @@@@
&gt; The fourth operation has brought back a 2.4 mL sample of an unidentified amber-colored liquid and a cuboid sample piece of diamond containing regular etched patterns with stored information. The composition of the liquid was later identified to have been polysiloxane compounds dissolved with low amounts of silicon-oxygen clusters, which is very likely to be remains of previously existing organisms with silicon-oxygen compounds as their chemical basis.
&gt; @@@@
&gt; Considering that the pillars are speculated to be formed 3.8 billion years ago, it is unlikely that the structures are built by any of the carbon-based organisms. In fact, this point of time is even earlier than the earliest period of time that carbon-based life occurred. Thus, we could confirm that we have discovered direct evidence of the existence of a form of life based on silicon-oxygen compounds, which is totally different from almost all of the currently known organisms as carbon-based life, and this area may be ruins of a colony of these silicon-oxygen-based organisms.

[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5814/Si|caption=A specimen of silicon-oxygen-based organisms discovered in the operation.]]

Direct evidence of the existence of life based on silicon-oxygen compounds was discovered in nearby sedimentary rock layers during the sixth exploration operation. Some fossil-like fragments of a previously unknown creature were found, along with the existence of some silicate particles encapsulating some catalytically-active cluster molecules, which are mainly composed of silicon and oxygen. 

These particles were then confirmed to be spore-like propagules of a silicon-based life, which lives on silicate minerals. To cultivate these organisms, a solvent called dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) should be used to replace water. The relative dielectric constant of DMSO is 48, significantly lower than the value of water (around 80), thus the requirement of DMSO for this organism could be explained by the effect of SCP-5814 which has raised the dielectric constant of water.

**Addendum IV.**  Extract of PMRI&#39;s report on latest progress about clay hypothesis[[footnote]]A hypothesis about the origin of life. This theory proposes that the primitive form of cells is small bubbles in aluminosilicate clay minerals containing biomacromolecules. The clay minerals are capable of catalyzing the formation of these macromolecules and protecting them against hydrolytic decomposition.[[/footnote]]（█/█/2019）

&gt;  It is postulated that clay minerals have played essential roles in the origin of carbon-based life on the Earth. There are already views pointing out that clay minerals can store energy from mechanical force and cosmic rays, and may drive the formation of primordial organic molecules with such energy.[[footnote]]Reference: Coyne, L. M., Lawless, J., Lahav, N., Sutton, S., &amp; Sweeney, M. (1981). Clays as prebiotic photocatalysts. In Origin of life (pp. 115-124). Springer, Dordrecht.[[/footnote]]. In fact, there have been multiple publications focusing on this hypothesis recently. A lot of pieces of evidence have justified the possibility of this theory that porous structure inside the clay minerals may absorb carbon-containing small molecules that can create life, such as amino acids, allowing them to react in the clay hydrogel, resulting in important biomacromolecules.[[footnote]]Reference: Yang, D., Peng, S., Hartman, M. R., Gupton-Campolongo, T., Rice, E. J., Chang, A. K., ... &amp; Luo, D. (2013). Enhanced transcription and translation in clay hydrogel and implications for early life evolution. Scientific reports, 3, 3165.[[/footnote]]
&gt; @@@@
&gt; Recent results from our internal research have also shown that the formation of carbon-based lifeforms is very likely to be based within vesicles of clay minerals containing transition metal elements. The formation of such vesicles in a silicon-rich environment is not difficult. They raise carbon-based life just like the alchemists&#39; flasks raising homunculus.[[footnote]]Artificial human-like creatures in alchemical legends.[[/footnote]]
&gt; @@@@
&gt; However, another possibility emerges when switching points of view. just as how fungi live on the nutritions of deadwood, would carbon-based organisms be founded on the corpses of silicon-based life?
&gt; @@@@
&gt; Recently the team studying SCP-5814 has reported on some notable discoveries. They analyzed the sample ores from Greenland regions collected since 1991 and unexpectedly discovered some polysiloxane liquids within the ores, which contains high content of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, phosphorus, and silicon-oxygen clusters with unusually complex structures. From the viewpoint of an inorganic synthesis chemist, such compounds can be thought of as some precursors to the synthesis of silicate minerals. 
&gt; @@@@
&gt; We have never discovered such compounds in nature previously, as according to current experimental results, such compounds should have been unstable under the conditions for hydrothermal mineralization. But if we take into account SCP-5814&#39;s effects, then we will naturally come to the conclusion: such molecules belonged to the corpses of a form of life based on the silicon-oxygen skeleton. 
&gt; @@@@
&gt; The silicates in the region have existed since about 3.7 billion years ago. The formation of silicates generally indicates the collapse of the complex systems based on silicon-oxygen clusters; in other words, the domination of silicon-based lifeforms on the Earth, if ever existed, have ended about 3.7 billion years ago. Coincidentally, this is the time period hypothesized by modern biology to be when carbon-based lifeforms have originated on the Earth.
&gt; @@@@
&gt; Taking Freking&#39;s law into consideration, we found that when the Earth was just formed, carbon-containing compounds were too inert to evolve anything that could be called life. But just at the point of time of approximately 3.7 billion years ago, SCP-5814 has made the chemistry of carbon close to the edge of being able to evolve life. Though with the condition then, to reach such results would require assistance from some catalysts, which the aforementioned clay can take on such a role.

**Addendum V.**  Interpretation work on information within diamond crystal discovered in the exploration

[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5814/kaleidoscope|caption=Microscopic observation of the internal pattern of the diamond sample. Colors observed in the photo were caused by interference of light between etched patterns.]]

During the 4^^th^^ operation exploring the area in Greenland Region mentioned before, a finely polished black moissanite[[footnote]]A type of hard mineral ore with the main component as silicon carbide.[[/footnote]] sphere was discovered. It was then confirmed using the center of gravity that one side of the moissanite sphere was hollow and the other side was solid. After breaking the sphere&#39;s hollow side, a piece of the cuboid colorless diamond sample of dimensions 1.2 × 1.5 × 0.8 cm was taken out, with etched traces inside. It is currently unknown if the method of etching such patterns.

On █/██/2020, the deciphering work on information stored within diamond crystal was generally finished. It was proven that stored content was a quintuply mathematically encrypted radio wave signal, with a frequency of ██-██GHz. Excluding environment noise, a complicated periodic signal can be identified which was speculated to be an analytic language; only the meaning of a portion of vocabulary was identified. The wave record lasted for 17 minutes and 24 seconds.
