**Special Containment Procedures:** Inspections will be performed on a monthly basis to ensure that SCP-3730 remains functional. All testing with SCP-3730 must be approved by Level 3/3730 personnel. Standard wind tunnel safety guidelines will be followed by personnel when the anomaly is in operation.

**Description:** SCP-3730 is a 3.7m-long wind tunnel built by the Foundation at Site-201 in 1995, which began exhibiting anomalous properties three months after construction. If the model of an aircraft or other airborne vehicle is present in SCP-3730 when it is activated, variable anomalous phenomena will manifest for the duration of the machine&#39;s use. These phenomena are dependent on what vehicle the model represents.

**Addendum:**  The following is an abridged list of SCP-3730 tests.

||~ Date||~ Model Vehicle||~ Outcome||~ Notes||
||6-March-1995||[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3920 Observational Plane San-14]||Cumulonimbus clouds continually formed in front of the model, dissipating after moving past it.||This is the first anomalous event to occur in SCP-3730.||
||8-June-1996||SCPF-16G Fighter Jet||Two miniature F-16 aircraft, possessing the same size as the model, manifested in the wind tunnel. After three minutes each F-16 fired a missile at the model, creating a small fireball and breaking it.||None||
||12-September-1997||SCPS //Lance// Emergency Escape Capsule||Intense flames surrounded the model, resembling aerodynamic predictions for the capsule&#39;s atmospheric reentry. A large quantity of salt water then spilled out of the fan and filled much of the chamber, with a parachute appearing on the capsule.||None||
||29-April-1998||SSTO[[footnote]]Single-stage-to-orbit.[[/footnote]] Spaceplane Yodh-0||No irregularities were observed until the wings of the model began to intensely vibrate, shearing off after one minute.||An inspection of the craft performed after the test found structural flaws that, if not repaired, would result in the wings breaking in the same manner.||
||2-February-1999||Cargo Aircraft Lamedh-12||Snow accumulated on the tunnel floor, apparently resistant to the wind being generated. After three hours the snow had formed piles resembling a region of the Sayan Mountains. A small stone was then blown out of SCP-3730&#39;s fan and landed in one of the piles.||This event allowed the Foundation to locate Lamedh-12 and recover its crew. The plane had crashed in the mountain range after accidentally entering Russian Anomalous Airspace Zone 2 and encountering an unknown aircraft.||
||4-February-1999||RAAZ-2 Unknown Aircraft||Snow blew out of the fan, occasionally stopping when lights resembling the aurora borealis manifested.||The model was based off of blurry photographs taken from Lamedh-12. No conclusive information on the aircraft has been obtained.||
||1-August-2001||1986 Dodge Caravan||A small featureless humanoid manifested on top of the model, tapping their foot and pacing about. The humanoid turned to face a security camera and shrugged immediately before vanishing.||This was the first test to be done with the model of a non-airborne vehicle.||
||26-July-2002||SCP-3730||No anomalous effects were observed until the model was analyzed after testing. An apparently indefinite number of models within models had manifested, reaching microscopic scales. During analysis SCP-3730 abruptly lost power, corresponding to the model shattering.||None||
||22-January-2004||Exploratory Jet Samekh-9[[footnote]]A VTOL aircraft designed for the exploration of an extradimensional space that manifested at Lonar Lake.[[/footnote]]||The cockpit of Samekh-9 and its pilots appeared in SCP-3730, broken off from the main vehicle.||The following day Samekh-9 entered the extradimensional space, encountering a temporal anomaly that transported the crew to the previous day after the craft was irreparably damaged by hostile organisms.||
||6-March-2005[[footnote]]This occurred ten years after SCP-3730 first exhibited anomalous properties.[[/footnote]]||None||SCP-3730 spontaneously activated and manifested a large amount of confetti. After deactivation a slip of paper with a stylized rendition of a smiley face on one side and the phrase &#34;Hope I have helped!&#34; on the other was found.||After observed morale improvements among members of Research Team 3730, approval was granted by the Site-201 Research Council to continue testing SCP-3730 for an indefinite period of time.||
