So this is probably where I&#39;d add an inspirational quote, but I&#39;m not that smart. Or inspirational for that matter. Any-who: Welcome to HunterDog&#39;s totally original page, this is 100% (of 0%) the first article ever made (it definitely isn&#39;t) and is completely the first like this. I don&#39;t have a character or whatever, I make up my own, as Dr. Dog just isn&#39;t it, so it&#39;s not like a personnel page or anything.
Anyway, I like food, so I&#39;m probably just gonna stick some pictures of food I like:

Hey! I made some stuff (surprisingly.)

[[[SCP-5450]]] - Fintastic Soup, figures. It&#39;s food, but when eaten. You become shark-ized. Maybe Sharkinator-9000 would have been a better name. Yeah, probably not. Made it in seven hours for Jam-Con 2020.

[[[SCP-5750]]] - Can&#39;t say no to cookies! Man I crave some thin mints now. Seriously though they are delicious. Made this in six hours for Jam-Con 2020.

[[[critter-profile-potoooooooo|Critter Profile: Potoooooooo]]] - Even if I made him, I still love him. My first article! Made this in a day for Jam-Con 2020.

[[tab About Me]]
So now I gotta make a page about myself? Who&#39;s idea was this. Anyway I&#39;m HunterDog, or Dog. I love articles with a comedic, sad, or wholesome tone. Comedy articles are foremost my favorite, wholesome being next. Sad is the other emotion. I&#39;m not the most emotional person, so good, sad pieces can spark something.

Seriously. Who&#39;s idea was this, it means I gotta write more. Yeesh.
So more things about me:
I love Wilsons Articles. Seriously, I love all the critters.
I don&#39;t really read any other GoI&#39;s other than wilsons.
I love silly ideas over serious ideas. While serious ideas are good for important pieces, I tend to actually prefer sillier articles.
I love food. Send me food articles. (Not Ambrose though.)
My favorite PoI is dado. Simple, makes sense if you get to know me. Send me dado SCPS.
I love the occasional long article. If it&#39;s kept me through, I don&#39;t mind the length.

Horrible Comedy. Please, I love to laugh/smile.

[[size 150%]]Klaid Chandler[[/size]]
[[/=]]
----
**Character Name and Title:** Site Director Klaid Chandler

**Clearance Level:** Level 4

**Location:** He currently resides in Miami, Florida, and works at Site-86.

**History:** Klaid Chandler has extensive training in things related to economics, political science and foreign affairs. His training in the supernatural has ranged the past 14 years of his life.

**Characterization:** Klaid Chandler is a very angry man. He has horrible anger issues, and often says things without thinking. This can either go horribly, or unnoticed. Either way, this tends to be his biggest flaw, and isn&#39;t something that should always be overlooked. If you use my GoI (The girl scouts) I recommend using this fella as the site director.

&gt; 
&gt; **Notes:** Feel free to use him in pieces you decide to have set in his area, to properly use him there&#39;s a few things to note:
&gt; He&#39;s entirely serious, humor flies over his head.
&gt; Beating around the bushes annoys him.
&gt; He&#39;s very impatient.
&gt; He doesn&#39;t always think before running his mouth.
