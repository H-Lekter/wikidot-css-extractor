**Note to all contributors:**

Please include your name on all records, along with the date and the total number of items &#34;refined.&#34;

REMINDERS TO CONTRIBUTORS: SCP-914 does not create or destroy matter, nor does it change anything on the atomic level. All outputs should contain all and only the matter included in the input. Some grandfathered entries break this rule, but new entries should never do so.

**Additional reminder: 914 is a cheeky little bugger. It&#39;s unpredictable and apparently kinda snarky. If the output is exactly what you&#39;d expect from the input, or if 914 has just obligingly improved everything you put in, the entry is out-of-character.**

* [[*user Leveritas]] (me) will regularly check this page, selecting logs that are of sufficient quality to add to the log and port them over.
* Tests that fail to adhere to the proper format (date, etc.) will **not** be ported until fixed.
* You can place notes at the end of tests, and feel free to be creative when doing so. It can give some interesting insight into dynamics within the Foundation. Having said that, don&#39;t make Foundation personnel look like idiots/psychopaths/juvenile/a combination of those. It&#39;s a professional research organization, not a fraternity ward or a death cult.
* Not too direct. 914 doesn&#39;t talk to researchers directly, it ruins the mystery and it&#39;s not clear if the machine is sentient or not. If you put in a note, you don&#39;t get a response, you might get something that might be a response if you interpret it a certain way, but it also might be random. Or something else entirely.
* Ownership of content posted to the 914 log is retained by log curators as stewards over any content therein. As such, any authors contributing to the logs cede any future claims to said content to the collaboration log curator.

+++++ If you&#39;re not comfortable with your in-universe name being used, politely request a change or come to me about it. 

**Notice: On another note, changing these notices will result in disciplinary actions, meaning Site banning, not just this log.** 

Some of you might have noticed that I&#39;m being harsher on notes and logs that I deem too LOLFoundation. To illustrate my point, I&#39;m going to use an example from part IV:

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Half-Life 3?&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]

**Name:** Jr. Researcher Redmar 
**Date:** 20/03/2019
**Total Items:** One CD containing “Half Life” for PC

**Input:** Mentioned above
**Setting:** Very Fine 
**Output:** An extremely bright light consisting of [REDACTED] Lumens, which faded after 15 seconds, revealing a CD with the cover art resembling that of Half Life 2, but the 2 was replaced with 3. When inserted into a disk drive, an image with the word: “NOPE” appeared on screen, followed by a noise resembling human laughter.

//Note: Jr. Researcher Redmar has requested reassignment. Granted. - Dr. Veritas//

[[/collapsible]]

I actually edited the note. This is what it originally was:

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Half Life 3? Original&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]

**Name:** Jr. Researcher Redmar 
**Date:** 20/03/2019
**Total Items:** 1 CD containing “Half Life 2” for PC

**Input:** Mentioned above 
**Setting:** Very Fine 
**Output:** An extremely bright light consisting of [REDACTED] Lumens, which faded after 15 seconds, revealing a CD with the cover art resembling that of Half Life 2, but the 2 was replaced with 3. When inserted into a disk drive, an image with the word: “NOPE” appeared on screen, followed by a noise resembling human laughter.

//Note: Fuck you, 914 - Jr. Researcher Redmar// 

[[/collapsible]]

This is a very small difference, but it makes a world of difference in tone. The first entry works a lot better because it&#39;s not a researcher scolding the machine outright as a kid would. It&#39;s **implying** (read, show don&#39;t tell) that the researcher became so fed up with the result that he outright left. Wacky entries work well if it&#39;s against the cold professionalism that signifies the Foundation, and it **doesn&#39;t work** if it looks like the employees are acting just as unprofessional.

++ General Notes

+++++ Notices for everyone.

1. If you didn&#39;t bother reading the above division of obviously important text, click [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-914-experiment-log-guidelines here]!
2. Mod will remove notes if they are too excessive/LOLFoundation/unprofessional.
3. Part XVIII is up and running! Find your tests [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/experiment-log-914/offset/17 here].
4. New log-writers, **please do not use other writers&#39; characters without asking**. It is generally seen as bad form. If you want to use someone&#39;s character, most of the writers can be contacted via Wikidot PM or, for a quicker response, [[[https://discord.gg/UPXXUJmFYc | the 914 Discord server]]].
5. Everyone is invited to join the above Discord server. This also facilitates easier communication with the mod. If you notice something wrong with a particular test in Experiment Log 914, you can either point it out in the server or do so below.
6. //Please//, no more introduction notes. 914 is supposed to be unpredictable, and there’s only so many times it can turn handwriting into different handwriting or a drawing before you start predicting it.

**Name:** Dr. Edwards
**Date:** 24/08/2021
**Total Items:** A //Nerf//-brand dart gun

**Input:** Dart gun
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A //Nerf//-brand dart gun which pressurizes air up to 15.0 bars, able to launch a dart at Mach 2. However, due to air resistance and other physical factors, the dart is completely shredded into an uncountably large amount of foam shreds upon firing, rendering the dart gun completely useless in environments other than nearly-complete vacuums. Object also appears to be able to anomalously teleport air into the dart gun&#39;s pressurization chamber. Air teleported into the pressurization chamber appears to be immune to the effects of a vacuum, which under normal circumstances would suck the air out. Incinerated.
