**Introductory Note:** Much of the following information regarding [[[SCP-1985]]] still requires deciphering due to an unusual internal information storage &amp; clearance system. (For example, in some instances, highly classified information has been recovered but information of lower classification has not.)

Information recovery is ongoing. Your current access level is: **LEVEL 3**. Certain information is restricted to Level 4, Level 5, or to SAP &#34;Cantilevered Muskrat&#34;.

&gt; **Project Codename:** Rhodes[[footnote]]Only one reference to Project Rhodes exists in current Foundation archives outside of SCP-1985 files. Further information is restricted Level 5.[[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt; **Project#:** PRJRDS-006205
&gt; 
&gt; **Sub-Project Identification Label:** K-Class Scenario Research Device R-21
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** R-21 is currently the most successful K-Class Scenario Research Device. [UNDECIPHERED] preceded by many discarded devices and human specimens. 
&gt; 
&gt; [UNDECIPHERED]
&gt; 
&gt; **Anomalous Artifact Construction Notes:** [UNDECIPHERED] along with a surprising amount of information extrapolated from [[[SCP-201|SCP-1005]]]&#39;s anomalous function.[[footnote]]SCP-1005 appears to refer to [[[SCP-201]]], not [[[SCP-1005]]].[[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt; **[[[SCP-507|SCP-2914]]]:**[[footnote]]SCP-2914 appears to refer to [[[SCP-507]]], not [[[SCP-2914]]].[[/footnote]] R-21&#39;s trans-universal teleportation method is primarily based on extensive research on 2914. Since 2914&#39;s death, its exact anomalous attributes have been duplicated three times, unfortunately permanently psychologically destabilizing each subject. [RECOVERED EXPUNGED DATA: Duplication has failed in the remaining 197 experimental subjects.] None of these three subjects can be considered suitable for extra-reality expeditions. 
&gt; 
&gt; [UNDECIPHERED] Further, 2914&#39;s ability will not work at all when not implanted in a human being. It must be partially controlled and activated by a partially organic device. However, it has been impossible to replicate the higher-brain functions unique to 2914 which allowed it to be affected by its ability without losing sanity. All these factors are what primarily requires a device implanted in a human subject, combined with [RECOVERED EXPUNGED DATA: elements of the organic &#39;brain&#39; of SCP-1313 instances.[[footnote]]SCP-1313 does not appear to refer to [[[SCP-1313]]]. Reference is so far unknown.[[/footnote]] ]
&gt; 
&gt; Despite extensive experimentation, researchers have not been able to perfectly replicate the &#39;safety feature&#39; that 2914 apparently utilized during its teleportation, that allowed it to arrive in areas (//relatively//) safe for human habitation. R-21 and two other Rhodes subjects display a functional safety feature that will only activate upon return but works improperly upon initial trip, only going as far as to &#34;hinge&#34; the subject to the Earth&#39;s crust [UNDECIPHERED]
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1313:**[[footnote]]SCP-1313 does not appear to refer to [[[SCP-1313]]]. Reference is so far unknown.[[/footnote]] [UNDECIPHERED] for the neural network to function and properly target specific realities despite (or perhaps because of) biological nature. Programming must consist of a specific &#34;goal-set&#34; that is simple, easily understood, and extensively documented. Naturally, this does not propose a problem. [UNDECIPHERED]
&gt; 
&gt; [UNDECIPHERED] Unfortunately, it is difficult to test the protection from reality shifts derived from SCP-4879 and SCP-4777.[[footnote]]Section does not refer to SCP-4879 or SCP-4777. Further information is restricted Level 5.[[/footnote]] Four subjects have been wiped from existence in localized events already. RK-21 is ███ ██ ███ ████ ████████ in which protection seems to be fully functioning.
&gt; 
&gt; [UNDECIPHERED] It is unknown if this course of action could result in the triggering of another event, but it is considered doubtful. Circumstantial fallout of Project ███████ aside, we feel the risks are acceptable.
