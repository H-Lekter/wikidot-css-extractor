Don Valentine, ninth-dimensional space admiral and venture capitalist, admired the ultraviolet mural emblazoned on the side of NeXT&#39;s stylized corporate campus building. 

Beside Don stood Steve Jobs, CEO and Chairman of both the company and a vast dimension of collective consciousness. &#34;Yeah, we&#39;re the only company in the valley- and this //is// still the valley, technically- that offers same-sex couples equal benefits to the heterosexuals.&#34;

&#34;Ah, that&#39;s nifty. But I&#39;m sure the insurance paperwork must be a nightmare.&#34;

Steve threw his hands into the air. &#34;Oh, Don, //Don//, you have no idea. Let me take you inside to meet the gang.&#34;

As they walked in, one of Don&#39;s floating eyes lingered its gaze on the image for a few moments. &#34;But why is it ultraviolet?&#34;

The first thing a visitor would notice was that the space inside the building was far larger than that outside. Steve and Don knew the way, as they walked and talked a few new managers floated in the endless void below, struggling to get a grip.

&#34;Well, honestly it was at the request of our community members. They didn&#39;t really want to advertise their presence to... the wider culture, so to speak, but we didn&#39;t want that to mean we couldn&#39;t show off how insanely brave and great they are, that we are //proud// of them.&#34;

&#34;Always a sucker for a counter-culture, you haven&#39;t changed a lick, have you Steve?&#34;

&#34;You know me, Don. Always thinking different, often thinking broke, but thinking better all the time all the same.&#34;

They were approaching a tanned surfer sitting at a desk. Soldering a circuit board, they hardly even glanced up as Steve and Don approached. &#34;Must I suffer another heckler&#39;s veto already, Steve?&#34;

&#34;Not yet, Buster. I got someone I want you to meet. Don Valentine, this is Keaton Bicknell, one of our top engineers and a damned good dancer.&#34; Steve clasped his hand on Keaton&#39;s shoulder, almost making them flick their iron&#39;s wick.

&#34;I wish you would stop saying that.&#34; Glancing up, Keaton nodded at Don before returning to their work. &#34;A pleasure. Now, Steve, if you want me to have something to show you today you&#39;re gonna have to let me get back to it.&#34;

&#34;So we shall!&#34; Steve was already halfway out where the door would have been if there were any offices (other than his own) to speak of anywhere. Hustling to keep up, Don left a protoplasmic trail behind which, luckily for the night crew, evaporates with almost no lingering odor.

&#34;Neeeext up, we&#39;ve got a lovely little lady down from a little ol&#39; state called Louisiana, give it up foooor...&#34;

Stopping on a dime, Steve slammed a hand over his mouth. Pearl Higgins was on the phone, and even he knew better than to interrupt her. Mouthing &#39;another time&#39;, he tiptoed out of range before backpedaling back into a near sprint. &#34;Okay, looks like everyone&#39;s busy today... who... might, be... free...&#34;

Striding at full pace, Steve ducked between NeXT&#39;s community members, but all were otherwise occupied. //It&#39;s almost like we&#39;re here during business hours.// Steve chuckled.

Don was gasping for Don&#39;s proverbial breath. &#34;Alright, Steve. Give me a second to rest, do you ever not go a mile a minute?&#34;

&#34;Not on your life pal. Can we talk investment in the down time?&#34;

Don shuddered ambivalently. &#34;You&#39;ve got a nice building, and seem like you&#39;re taking care of your people, but what&#39;s the endgame here?&#34;

&#34;We want to put a ding in the universe.&#34;

Sighing, Valentine manifested a checkbook in Don&#39;s gaseous manifold. &#34;I suppose we have had good times. Anybody have a pair of hands I could borrow to make out a check?&#34;

Steve smiled, and held up a pen. &#34;That&#39;ll do, Don. That&#39;ll do.&#34;</textarea></pre>
