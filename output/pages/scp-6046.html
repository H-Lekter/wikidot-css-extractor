    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>Item#:SCP-6046 “the rotting spikes”

Object class: Euclid 

Special containment procedures: SCP-6046 is to be contained in its cell a 12 m x 10 m x 12 m chamber with 0.4m thick walls. Daily checks for any escape attempts are mandatory. There are to be no visits for 0-4 or above personnel. Only Class D and low level researchers are permitted to visit 6046. No more than 2 people from different Classes are allowed in SCP-6046’s chamber at a time. Class D and Researchers are required to have a mask of rotten flesh on hand in case SCP-6046 becomes hostile. 

If SCP-6046 becomes hostile and personnel is unable to put on the mask the other must quarantine in case of 6046’s affects 

Description: SCP-6046 is a humanoid creature measuring 1.78 meters in height. The subject is shown to have a big muscle mass, with thick,long and sharp spikes growing and hurting itself until it reaches 2.9 meters in length each. Skin is rotten leaving a foul odor that is used as a way to disguise personnel. No signs of damage from anything other than the spikes can be seen on 6046’s body.

SCP-6046’s head can be detached and will grow spikes which only take a few moments to grow. It can move at a speed of 25 mph while the body’s speed can only go up to 13 mph. When detached the body is left like a rag doll unable to move it loses all senses and abilities, the spikes begin to return to its original state of 0.3 meters sticking outside of the body.

SCP-6046 at most times it is docile it shall only become hostile when 1: threatened 2: attacked 3:given an ominous off putting sense.It will spend most of its days crawling around the chamber trying to find any escape methods. When someone is to set off either 3 of the key causes of hostility SCP-6046 will begin to tear off the head and lift itself to the highest place it can. There is an approximate three (3) to five (5) minute window before SCP-6046 begins to leap at the person and begin to tear off the person&#39;s limbs and begin to dissect them.

From the foundation&#39;s current  understanding SCP-6046 only dissects them to learn more about humanity. Sometimes it will show signs of pleasure,guilt or nothing at all after dissection.</textarea></pre>
