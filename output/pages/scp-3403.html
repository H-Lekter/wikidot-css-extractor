**Item #:** SCP-3403

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3403 is to be kept within a secure item locker when not in use. Requests for testing may be submitted to the Research Director at SCP-3403&#39;s site of containment (Field Office 352-Zayin as of 01/10/2015). Following any testing or transport, SCP-3403 is to be rinsed in water and wiped clean to prevent manifestation of anomalies.

**Description:** SCP-3403 is a rectangular concrete box measuring approximately 17.75 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm. The object has no external openings, but contains a hollow aperture housing several materials. Following penetrative imaging and substance analysis, the space within SCP-3403 was determined be filled primarily with charred organic material identified as cremated mammal remains, surrounding a small assembly composed of a circuit board connected to a dried flower (//Eichhornia crassipes//) by means of short wires curled around the stem. Analysis also revealed a short text passage inscribed on the interior surface of the object, the contents of which may be found in Document 3403-A01.

The anomaly associated with SCP-3403 manifests when the object is fully covered with soil on all six sides. Under these conditions, three instances of SCP-3403-1 will manifest within 1000 square meters of the spot at which the object is buried inside of 24 hours. Instances of SCP-3403-1 are incorporeal images resembling specific domesticated canines. They have no measurable mass or volume, and the space occupied by their bodies measures on average 5 degrees Celsius warmer than the surrounding air. Instances behave in a manner consistent with non-anomalous canines, though they are apparently unable to detect humans. Left alone, instances will play with one another, chase non-human animals, and periodically rest. All manifestation of SCP-3403-1 ceases once SCP-3403 is no longer in contact with soil on all sides.

The instances of SCP-3403-1 have been designated as follows:

__SCP-3403-1-A:__ Male boxer, apparent joint pain and occasional seizures, highly active, estimated 13 years of age

__SCP-3403-1-B:__ Female bull mastiff, slight limp in rear left leg, moderately active, estimated 8 years of age

__SCP-3403-1-C:__ Male bull mastiff, missing right ear, lethargic, estimated 4 years of age

SCP-3403 was recovered from an empty lot in St. Johns, Florida on 09/04/2014, following numerous reports of &#34;ghost dogs&#34; in the area. No further associated incidents have been reported following recovery.

&gt; **Test Date:** 09/10/2015
&gt; 
&gt; **Purpose:** Control
&gt; 
&gt; **Procedure:** Object placed on a tarp; not exposed to soil
&gt; 
&gt; **Result:** No anomalies noted within 36 hour monitoring period.

&gt; **Test Date:** 09/13/2015
&gt; 
&gt; **Purpose:** Reproduction of original anomaly
&gt; 
&gt; **Procedure:** Object buried .5 m underground in vicinity of Field Office
&gt; 
&gt; **Result:** All instances of SCP-3403-1 manifested within 24 hours. All three instances appeared to show slight reduction of sensory awareness relative to original manifestation.

&gt; **Test Date:** 09/14/2015
&gt; 
&gt; **Purpose:** Reproduction of original anomaly
&gt; 
&gt; **Procedure:** Object buried .5 m underground at original site of recovery
&gt; 
&gt; **Result:** All instances of SCP-3403-1 manifested within 24 hours. Instances demonstrated none of the irregularities seen in previous test.
&gt; 
&gt; **Notes:** Anomaly seems most effective at original location. Possibly due to soil conditions - further research ideal.

&gt; **Test Date:** 09/16/2015
&gt; 
&gt; **Purpose:** Test potency of anomaly manifestation using different soil
&gt; 
&gt; **Procedure:** Object surrounded in 1 cubic m of soil sourced from Brantley, Georgia
&gt; 
&gt; **Result:** All instances of SCP-3403-1 manifested within 27 hours. SCP-3403-1-B and -C appeared to have senses significantly impaired relative to original manifestation. SCP-3403-1-A appeared to be totally devoid of sight, hearing, and smell.
&gt; 
&gt; **Note:** This suggests the earlier hypothesis was correct. Glad getting that soil wasn&#39;t a waste of time.

&gt; **Test Date:** 09/18/2015
&gt; 
&gt; **Purpose:** Test limits of anomaly manifestation
&gt; 
&gt; **Procedure:** Object surrounded in 1 cubic m of beach sand, dried and sifted
&gt; 
&gt; **Result:** All instances of SCP-3403-1 manifested within 36 hours. All instances were devoid of fur, with SCP-3403-1-C missing several patches of skin and SCP-3403-1-A completely devoid of skin. SCP-3403-1-A de-manifested and re-manifested in irregularly-timed bursts over 36 hour monitoring period. Space occupied by all instances measured significantly warmer (~15 deg. C) than recorded in original manifestation. All instances appeared confused and physically uncomfortable. SCP-3403-1-B observed to gravitate to areas of deep shade, to no apparent effect.

&gt; **Test Date:** 09/21/2015
&gt; 
&gt; **Purpose:** Test limits of anomaly manifestation
&gt; 
&gt; **Procedure:** Object suspended using cable in a 1 cubic m tank of water with approx. 50 g of soil mixed in
&gt; 
&gt; **Result:** SCP-3403-1-B and SCP-3403-1-C manifested within 48 hours. Both instances observed to produce significantly more saliva relative to original manifestation, as well as exhibited behavior associated with hydrocephalus. SCP-3403-1-C de-manifested and re-manifested repeatedly over 36 hour monitoring period, but occasionally exhibited physical irregularities upon re-manifestation (e.g. excessive hair, elongated bones). SCP-3403-1-A not observed to manifest.

&gt; **Test Date:** 09/25/2015
&gt; 
&gt; **Purpose:** Reproduction of original anomaly
&gt; 
&gt; **Procedure:** Object buried .5 m underground at original site of recovery
&gt; 
&gt; **Result:** All instances of SCP-3403-1 manifested within 24 hours. Instances showed none of the physical irregularities observed in previous experiments, though all instances showed initial disorientation and confusion for several hours following manifestation. In particular, SCP-3403-1-A, though apparently conscious and responsive to external stimuli, did not move for 1.5 hours following manifestation. Within 4 hours of manifestation, all instances returned to original observed behavioral patterns.

&gt; I don&#39;t even have to ask; you were always cool.
