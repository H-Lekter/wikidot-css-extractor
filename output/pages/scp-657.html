**Item #:** SCP-657

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-657 is to be kept in a room 8m x 8m at Site-19 with a queen sized bed and any other reasonable furnishings as requested by SCP-657. 

--SCP-657 is allowed to freely move about the grounds of Site-19, so long as SCP-657 is accompanied by at least one staff member of at least level-2 security.-- Following experiment 657/076, SCP-657 is no longer allowed to leave his room. SCP-657 is to be allowed additional leeway with requests for entertainment following this loss of freedom in order to ensure the mental health of SCP-657. Two staff members of at least level-2 security are to be stationed at SCP-657&#39;s room in order to monitor SCP-657 and ensure that he does not leave. Staff members are to avoid physical contact with SCP-657 unless it becomes necessary to restrain him or for his own safety.

SCP-657 is to be fed three meals per day, provided with a daily multivitamin, and given a supply of medication for the treatment of his arthritis.

**Description:** SCP-657 appears to be a Caucasian male approximately fifty five years of age. SCP-657 is mostly bald, with a small amount of gray hair remaining. 1.75 meters in height, 77 kilograms. Subject prefers to wear three-button business suits, generally charcoal gray or navy blue in color, as well as bowler hats. All medical tests indicate that SCP-657 is an ordinary human male in his fifties of reasonably good health. SCP-657 prefers to be addressed as &#34;Gustav&#34; or &#34;Mr. Nobel&#34;, but will also respond to his SCP designation.

SCP-657 displays the ability to predict the time of an individual&#39;s death with extreme accuracy. In order to make a prediction, SCP-657 requires physical contact with the individual. This contact need not be prolonged or invasive, a handshake is sufficient. The precision of SCP-657&#39;s predictions seems largely dependent upon how imminent the death is. When exposed to D-class personnel scheduled for termination the following day, SCP-657 was able to accurately predict time of death down to the minute without access to scheduling information. When exposed to individuals for whom SCP-657 does not predict death for more than a decade, SCP-657 is generally unable to provide more than the year of death. SCP-657 claims to be unable to determine any other information about the cause or circumstances of an individual&#39;s death. To date, all of SCP-657&#39;s predictions have proven accurate.

For unknown reasons, SCP-657 claims his abilities simply do not work on a small number of individuals, including Agent ███████, Dr. ██████████, and Dr. █████. Polygraph testing supports these claims. No common link between these individuals has been established beyond their connection with the Foundation.

Individuals exposed to SCP-657 often report finding him disquieting, unpleasant, or simply &#34;creepy&#34;, regardless of whether or not they are aware of his abilities. Individuals who are aware of SCP-657&#39;s ability to predict death often attribute their discomfort to finding this aspect of him unsettling. Those who are unaware are usually unable to articulate a specific reason for disliking SCP-657.

**Addendum:** Notes on Recovery

SCP-657 was recovered in the city of █████████████████ in the United States. While employed as an undertaker at a large funeral home, SCP-657 became engaged in a heated argument with a subordinate with whom SCP-657 had previous disagreements. While correcting the subordinate&#39;s work, SCP-657 remarked &#34;What does it fucking matter? You&#39;ll be dead before the end of the week.&#34; in front of several witnesses. Following the subordinate&#39;s death three days later after falling from the roof of his home, SCP-657 was arrested by the local police department on suspicion of murder. While being apprehended, SCP-657 made similar remarks predicting the death of one of the police officers involved in his arrest, who was subsequently shot by a suspect in an unrelated incident two days later in the evening, as predicted by SCP-657.

SCP-657 came to the attention of the Foundation when the local police made a request for federal resources to investigate any possible connection between SCP-657 and the officer&#39;s shooting. Arrangements were made for SCP-657 to be tried and convicted of the murder of his subordinate and conspiracy to murder the officer who apprehended him, and sentenced to death. SCP-657 was extracted into Foundation custody using the same procedures for securing D-class personnel.

**Addendum 657-1:** Experiment 657/076

SCP-657 was introduced to [[[SCP-076 | SCP-076-2]]] as a potential recruit for Mobile Task Force Omega 7. This was a pretense to allow SCP-657 physical contact with SCP-076-2. Upon contact with SCP-076-2, SCP-657&#39;s eyes rolled back into his head and he lost consciousness. SCP-657 remained in a comatose state for slightly over a week. Upon recovering, SCP-657 claimed to have no memory of meeting SCP-076-2. Polygraph testing indicates these statements to be accurate. Following this incident, containment procedures for SCP-657 have been amended to ensure that SCP-657 does not come into contact with any other humanoid SCPs. Further experimentation involving exposing SCP-657 to humanoid SCPs may take place only with O5 clearance.
