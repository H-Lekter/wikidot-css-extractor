**Object Class:** --Safe-- Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedure:** --Object is to be kept in a standard containment case on the desk of Researcher Dr. Friedrich. If object is to be moved, for any reason Dr. Friedrich should be notified out of courtesy, though not necessary. Object should be returned at earliest convenience.-- Due to incident on 02/24&amp;25/2018, it has been deemed necessary to decommission SCP-5284. No further containment protocols, otherwise instructed by Level 4 personnel or above, are necessary.

**Description:** Object is a standard ACM15593 manual pencil sharpener that does not sharpen anything that is fed into it. The blade appears to be of fine integrity and no mechanical faults can be found with the manufacturing. However, even though the object does not shred or tear any mass from the item inserted into it, the sharpener will, upon use, start to expel shavings molecularly identical to the item inserted. This includes wood, steel, and organic tissue. SCP-5284 was discovered in a box of donated school supplies for a P-K school in [REDACTED], by the daughter of Researcher Dr. Friedrich.
 
__From Dr. Friedrich:__
//“Today my wife picked up my daughter from school. When entering the car my daughter was sobbing due to the fact that the children in her class teased her today because the sharpener she had chosen from the prize box, would not sharpen anything. Determined to lift her spirits, when I arrived home I asked to see it, I explained to her that sometimes the factory puts the blade on upside down, and then it will not work. I got out my Phillips screwdriver and reversed the blade, checking it for sharpness before placing back into its fixture. The item after that seemed to work, but in a peculiar way. Although the sharpener produced shavings of her colored pencils, the pencils themselves never shrank, nor did they become sharpened. I determined the object to be anomalous in nature and bought my daughter a My Little Pony backpack in exchange to make her feel better. I relocated the object to my office at Site-19 for experimentation.”//
 

##darkred|**__Experiment Log 1__**##
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Begin Test Log&#34; hide=&#34;- Submit Results&#34;]]
**__Experiment SCP-5284-A__**
**Item to be Sharpened:** Standard No. 2 Pencil
**Result:** As expected no sharpening of the pencil. However, an approximate amount of shavings proportional to the time and pressure spent sharpening was produced by SCP-5284.
 
**__Experiment SCP-5284-B__**
**Item to be Sharpened:** Blue BIC Pen
**Result:** Bic Pen was inserted and stayed fully intact, the object produced shards of plastic, small metal fragments and blue ink. Spectral analysis of both inks identifies them as being of same age and composition.
 
**__Experiment SCP-5284-C__**
**Item to be Sharpened:** Steel Metal Rod
**Result:** Metal Rod twisted very haphazardly inside SCP-5284 but was neither sharpened nor affected. Metal shards of the same density and molecular make up were produced from the item.
 
**__Conclusion:__**
I have deemed the object safe, and it shall remain on my desk in a standard containment case for anyone else looking to experiment on it.

**__Experiment SCP-5284-D__**
**Subject to be Sharpened:** D-Class Personnel (Juvenile’s 5th Digit)
**Result:** Subject showed initial signs of shock and horror as SCP-5284 was placed around his pinky finger, however, once aware of no perceived pain or threat, the D-Class proceeded to laugh. The object produced thin strips of skin, finely serrated cuts of meat, fragments of fingernails and bone. All organic tissue produced by SCP-5284 was genetically identical to the D-Class.

**__Experiment SCP-5284-E__** (Blade only)
**Subject to be Cut:** Piece of Paper
**Result:** As expected, paper unaffected, multiple strips produced.

**__Conclusion:__**
It seems that the casing and screw are inconsequential to the anomaly functioning. The blade is capable of duplicating shredded material without the ancillary pieces

**__Incident 02/24&amp;25/2018 Video Transcript Timeline:__**

**23:06:** Friedrich leaves office and leaves SCP-5284 is on his desk.

**23:15:** Bright takes SCP-5284 from office.

**23:16:** Bright attempts to use blade of SCP-5284 on [[[http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-963|SCP-963]]].

**23:16:** Shards of sparking material are seen coming off SCP-963.

**23:17:** Bright picks up shard, shrugs, laughs, then tosses the piece.

**23:23:** Bright heads to [[[http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-055|SCP-055’s]]] containment cell with blade of SCP-5284.

**23:24:** Memetic black out occurs at Site-19.

**23:24:** Multiple guards positioned at multiple containment blocks walk away and/or neglect stations.

**23:25 – 02:12:** Multiple containment breaches occur.

**23:28:** Friedrich is in Site-19, second floor break room, 12 filling a cup of coffee from the [[[http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-294|vending]]] machine.

**23:28:** [[[http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-106|SCP-106]]] reaches through vending machine and grabs Friedrich.

**23:32:** Bright returns to his office, sits at his desk and does not move for 24 hours.

**00:22 – 06:25:** Outside MTF teams and logistics personnel re-secure Site.

**07:11:** Shards of SCP-963 collected and relocated to [REDACTED]. Bright reprimanded.

//Given the unforeseen and unfortunate series of event transpiring on 02/24&amp;25/2018 at Site-19, by Bright and his use of SCP-5284, it is deemed necessary to neutralize SCP-5284, by separating the blade from the casing and burying it underneath the Site Warhead of Site-██. Please send Dr. Friedrich’s family flowers and a My Little Pony pencil sharpener offering our deepest regrets.//
