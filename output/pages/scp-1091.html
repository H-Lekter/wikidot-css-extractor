**Item #:** SCP-1091

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1091-1 is not to be removed from its containment room. The containment room is to be surrounded by a multi-stage Faraday cage. Three armed security personnel are to be stationed outside the containment room at all times. No radio devices are permitted within 200 meters of SCP-1091-1.

A live microphone feed must be active in the containment room, outside the Faraday cage to record any transmissions or sounds from SCP-1091-1 for later analysis. SCP-1091-1 is not to have radio contact with any radio transmitting/receiving device unless approved by Level-4 Personnel for controlled testing purposes. Personnel are not permitted contact with SCP-1091-1 without specific authorization. All personnel must be searched to find and remove any radio devices before contact with SCP-1091-1 is permitted.

If SCP-1091-1 transfers to another radio transmitting device, all personnel are instructed to seek out and destroy all radio devices within a 5 km radius. Should Foundation personnel be unable to locate and recover SCP-1091 within two hours, refer to Recall Protocol 1091-Beta.

**Description:** SCP-1091 is a sentient entity that resides in radio receiving and transmitting devices. If its host device possesses a microphone (or shortwave reception equipment) and speakers, SCP-1091 is capable of communicating.

SCP-1091 is capable of transferring itself between hosts by radio signal, at a range dependent on the broadcast power of its host device. Given the opportunity, it will use its ability to transfer between devices rapidly in an attempt to [DATA EXPUNGED]. SCP-1091 must not be allowed to reach its destination. Should such a scenario become a possibility, MTF Lambda-W is to refer to Recall Protocol 1091-Alpha.

Thus far, SCP-1091 has not demonstrated an ability to infect multiple devices simultaneously. However, this possibility cannot be entirely discounted.

If the host of SCP-1091 is destroyed or otherwise rendered unable to transmit before it is able to transfer, SCP-1091 will immediately become located in SCP-1091-1, regardless of distance. For this reason, it has been suggested that SCP-1091-1 is the original source of SCP-1091.

SCP-1091-1 resembles a model S-38 shortwave receiver, manufactured by the Hallicrafters company in the mid-1940s. However, the composite material comprising the outer shell of SCP-1091-1 appears to be a mixture of carbon fiber and an unidentified material. Additionally, all attempts at opening SCP-1091-1 for examination have failed.

All attempts to tune SCP-1091-1 have been ineffective. SCP-1091-1 plays only static until SCP-1091 initiates communication. Any other radio device within 500 meters of SCP-1091-1 will experience the same tuning failure. SCP-1091 is able to communicate with Foundation Personnel through various types of &#34;Digital Mode&#34; broadcasts. The choice of digital mode appears to be related to the person it is communicating with and the subject matter of the conversation.

**Interview Log 1091-a**

&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-1091
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Researcher █████████
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher █████████:** SCP-1091. Clearly, you have some form of sentience. Tell me, what is it that you were planning when we had recovered you?
&gt; 
&gt; //(SCP-1091 is silent for several seconds, before broadcasting a data burst transmission approximately 45 seconds in length.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher █████████:** Run that through the software, I want to know what this thing is thinking.

It was later determined that the transmission was an SSTV broadcast, in mode &#34;Robot36&#34;. Decoded image is listed below available audio clip of interview.
