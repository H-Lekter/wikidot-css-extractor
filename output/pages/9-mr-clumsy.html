__**Dear Diary**__

My name is Mr. Clumsy and I have died forty-seven times today.

I think the first time was when I was walking down the trail. I just went over to a cactus, thinking I could get some water. So, I took out my penknife and tried to cut a tiny gap in it. What happened instead was I stumbled, ended up with the knife in my heart and fell backwards onto the cactus.

Yep, that&#39;s my thing. I die horribly and then come back to do it again. And for some goddamn reason, no matter what I do, it&#39;ll more likely than not kill me. At least if I sit in this cave and don&#39;t touch anything, I&#39;ll be reasona

Sorry, heart attack. Guess that showed me. God knows how I&#39;m going to walk all the way to the place. Can&#39;t exactly take a car, can I? Last time I tried that, it exploded. Third-degree burns and everything. Lasted a bit before dying, hurt like hell. All the others have fun gimmicks, or at least ones that don&#39;t kill you, but no, not m

Got the pencil in my eye. Took me a few deaths to get that out. I heal my wounds, but I always have trouble with things getting stuck. Mr. Redd used to make a game of it; he&#39;d impale me on a pipe or something and watch me die again and again. Not my idea of fun, but what are you going to do? It&#39;s nothing personal, after a while, you just get used to dyi

Fell over and hit my head on a brick. I am sure that brick was not there when I found this cave. See, that&#39;s another thing, sometimes I&#39;ll go near a cat and start choking or something! I&#39;m not allergic to cats! I know, I checked with a doctor. Died three times, but I managed to get there.

I know if I fall asleep, a bear will eat my head or something. But I can&#39;t just walk, this is the desert and it&#39;s night. I&#39;ll freeze to death again and agai
