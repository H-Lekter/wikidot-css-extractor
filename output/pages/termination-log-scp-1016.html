Surveillance Log x219███, Date █-██-███

&gt; (Dr. Gears enters Containment area for SCP-1016-D)
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Gears:  “Good morning SCP-1016.”
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-1016:  “Hiya Doc!  And it’s ‘Ben’, remember?”
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Gears:  “I have been informed of your civilian designation.  I request that you accompany me to Testing Area 8-B for evaluation and testing of your ‘wireless’ connection to the Internet.”
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-1016:  “Hey, I already said I wouldn’t do anything you guys don’t want me to.  Besides, you can’t really block me…I’m behind seven proxies!”  (Several seconds of laughter)
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Gears:  “…if you would accompany me immediately, we can conclude testing in a timely fashion.”
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-1016:  (appears somewhat hurt and sulking) “…Ok.  Jeeze, lighten up man…”
&gt; 
&gt; (Dr. Gears and SCP-1016 exit the containment area.  Site Maintenance enters after several minutes and begins collection and disposal of SCP-1016 personal effects.)

------

**Excerpt from Termination Order 1881712-DDrt-1016:**

“..Due to our continued inability to prevent SCP-1016 from accessing the internet, its extremely destructive and poorly-controlled rage states, and multiple containment breaches via unauthorized server access, it has been determined that SCP-1016, in its current state, is too much of a security risk.  Measures MK118 and A-517 are to be taken immediately, to reduce…”

**Surveillance Log x8B11███, Date █-██-███**

&gt; (Dr. Gears and SCP-1016 enter testing area 8-B)
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-1016:  “Holy crap…that’s a big friggin’ server!  What’s with all the tools…want me to take it apart for ya?  Or maybe I get to upgrade again!”  (Several seconds of laughter)
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Gears:  “No, however you will be interacting with this system today.  There is a file sequence inside this system that has become deeply encrypted.  Please decrypt and access it.”
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-1016:  “Sweet!  Hey doc, can you get me some vitamins?  I’m hungry as hell…this shouldn’t take long at all, I’ll be done by the time you’re back!”
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Gears:  “I am required to remain present for the entirety of the testing period.”
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-1016:  “Okay, fine… whatever, man” (mumbles several inaudible words, before closing eyes and ‘interfacing” with the provided server.
&gt; 
&gt; (Eight minutes pass without incident, apart from small grunts or laughter from SCP-1016)
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-1016:  “Phew, that thing was buried!  Still, nothing…I…what is…WWWWWHAAA(inarticulate noises)
&gt; 
&gt; (SCP-1016 begins to thrash on the floor, holding its skull and bashing its forehead several times into the ground.  Several fluids begin to leak from the body of SCP-1016, later identified as oil, coolant, and silicone)
&gt;  
&gt; Dr. Gears:  “Initial contact made.  Initiating second stage decommissioning.”
&gt; 
&gt; (Dr. Gears removes several screwdrivers and a large set of pliers from a tool case.  SCP-1016 appears to be slowing down.)

------

**Excerpt from Termination Order 1881712-DDrt-1016:**

“…While the full destruction of SCP-1016 is warranted, the individual components have a level of research value that precludes this action.  Memetic Kill Agent 11010 will be issued directly to the processing centers of SCP-1016, “burning out” the areas controlling personality, will, and other psychological traits.  This will revert SCP-1016 to a “component parts” state, thereby allowing the initiation of the second stage of decommissioning.

Stage two will involve the physical break down of SCP-1016.  Non-essential biological components are to be disposed of, with essential biological components fitted with nutrient bath capsules to sustain operations.  The bulk of the components…”

**Post-Incident psychological evaluation transcript excerpt:**

&gt; Dr. Glass: &#34;Alright, let&#39;s see here... so, you doing okay Gears?  Everything okay up there?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Gears: &#34;I assure you, my mental state is in no way impaired.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Glass: &#34;So, I heard you decommissioned Ben.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Gears: &#34;This is correct. That is in fact, the reason for this evaluation. I expect you were aware of this.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Glass: &#34;Uh .. yeah.  So, listen, how are you feeling about that?  No .. guilt, or regret, or angst of any sort?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Gears: &#34;No sir. I was asked to perform my duty in as timely and efficient manner as possible. I did so. I do not see the reason for possible mental or emotional degradation.”
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Glass: &#34;Well, you just cooked the brains of a partially living being until they leaked out of his head.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Gears: &#34;I still fail to see...&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Glass: &#34;You tore out ...&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Gears: &#34;... the possible cause of ...&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Glass: &#34;His heart, with a screwdriver, while it was still beating...&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Gears: (Silence)
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Glass: (Silence)
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Gears: &#34;SCP-1016 needed to be decommissioned. I did so. The physical configuration of SCP-1016 makes no difference.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Glass. &#34;Right, well, how does this make you feel?&#34; [Holds up a flash card of a cartoon kitten about to be run over by a truck]
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Gears: &#34;I don&#39;t understand. It appears imminent that the kitten is -&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Glass: &#34;Yeah, okay, the usual.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Gears: &#34;Are we done here then?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Glass: &#34;Yessir. I&#39;ll just keep you under &#39;axiomatic preoccupations with duty, and complete lack of empathy&#39; as always.  Good eve, Gears.&#34;</textarea></pre>
