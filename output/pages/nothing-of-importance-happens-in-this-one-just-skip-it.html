= [[size 120%]]//&#34;MERDRE …&#34;//[[/size]]

Ruiz Duchamp starts at the woman in the frame. On the one hand, Ruiz finds the sight yet appealing. On the other, Ruiz stared into the bathroom mirror of a loft. 

Ruiz reflects. 

Had anything like this ever happened before, where a work of art had affected him so strongly? 
No, he had never been //that kind// of person who made //this kind// of art.

Then Ruiz wonders if his crazy brother Pico had ever done anything like this before? 
No, Pico is too crazy to even find this entertaining. 

= //Okay, Ruiz. Take a deep breath. You&#39;re a professional artist. Try improvising.//

Ruiz imposes a critical artist&#39;s eye on his surroundings.
Yes, indeed, Ruiz is in a loft. And there were two other women staring at --him-- her wide-eyed. Ruiz was [[[quintessence-of-dust |never good with women]]]. This will become a difficult situation where diplomatic sensitivity is required.

&#34;Are you absolutely sure we didn&#39;t screw up the ritual, [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-122-de Nora]?&#34; the older woman asks.

//Excellent//, Ruiz didn&#39;t have to explain to the other people why she was standing here. (He just had to decide which goddamned pronoun to use in his thoughts.)

&#34;Quite sure of it, [http://scp-wiki-de.wikidot.com/das-taegliche-leben-mit-quinnie-und-ihren-mitbewohner Quinnie]. Believe me, I hate nothing more than when an art project blows up,&#34; says the woman whose hair seems to change colour. She is flicking through a heavy volume, her eyes darting over the writing.

&#34;Ah right here!&#34; she turns to Ruiz, who had just sat down in the armchair for the time being until everything would have been cleared up, &#34;How did you, Mr ... Mr Duchamp pass away?&#34;

&#34;Which one? Theoretically, [[[ruiz-dies-again|I have already died at least twice.]]]&#34; To Ruiz&#39;s great delight, the voice of his current body was pleasantly deep and raspy for a woman. Matching his high and raspy one as a man.

&#34;In this case: The first time please.&#34;

&#34;With [[[wowwee-go-kill-ursefl|&#39;take shwoer 2 b cul&#39;]]]&#34;, and when the women failed to recognise his artwork, he added, &#34;Through a shower of liquid nitrogen&#34;. (Ruiz had decided to give a shit about the correct pronoun and be whatever he wanted. He was in the 21st century.)

The young woman frowns and stares alternately at Ruiz and the Spell Book. &#34;Technically, your body should be perfectly preserved in that case,&#34; she mumbles as she chews on her lip.

Her older colleague leans forward and taps on a line. They both look at each other and then at Ruiz, startled.  

&#34;What is it?&#34;, Ruiz wants to know. She leans forward in his new body. He didn&#39;t like the way the two of them were looking at her.

&#34;You must be strong now, Mrs Duchamp. Your body could possibly have been a victim of [[[wowwee-un-kill-ursefl|body snatching.]]]&#34;

Ruiz throws her arms in the air to express his following thoughts, forgetting that only he could hear his internal monologue.

= //FUCK. We&#39;re off to a good start again.//

Then he repeats it so that the others could hear her exclamation.

&#34;But who is interested in stealing my corpse anyway? I&#39;m just in the middle of too unpopular and not annoying enough for someone to dig me up,&#34; Ruiz thinks aloud, &#34;I&#39;m also sure Pico isn&#39;t involved, considering what he usually does with the bodies.&#34;

His two new friends shrug. &#34;We weren&#39;t, we can assure you of that.&#34;

&#34;Good point: why did you resurrect me in the first place?&#34;

The woman with the colourful hair blushes. &#34;Well, I wanted to ask you personally for advice on a work of anart, to be honest.&#34;

&#34;Can this wait until I catch my body snatcher?&#34;

The young woman gives a thumbs up. &#34;Sure, sounds more exciting than annoying //Die Kritikerin//.&#34;
