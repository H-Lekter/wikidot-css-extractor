An old man sat at his desk. The beeping and buzzing of the lab in the adjoining room produced a repetitive tune. He looked at the pictures on his desk. A melancholy smile crept on his lips.

&#34;Hey, Jake.&#34;

The man looked up. A colleague stood in the doorway.

&#34;You wanted me to swing by. What&#39;s up?&#34;

&#34;Afternoon, Roland,&#34; the man replied.  &#34;Go ahead and close the door.&#34;

He waited for his colleague to take a seat.

&#34;How&#39;s Lyssa?&#34;

&#34;Can&#39;t complain,&#34; his colleague chuckled. &#34;How about you? Kate? The kids?&#34;

&#34;Fine, as always,&#34; the man said.

The two men paused. The beeping and buzzing of the adjoining lab filled the gap. 

&#34;So. What&#39;s up?&#34; his colleague eventually asked.

The man sighed and looked once more over the pictures on his desk. 

Family. Old friends.

&#34;Do you think after I&#39;m gone, someone will still mention me?&#34; the man asked. &#34;Like, twenty years from now, they&#39;ll say &#39;Conwell sure had a solid lab. A lot of great publications came out of there&#39; or something?&#34;

His colleague raised an eyebrow. &#34;Yeah. Sure. You&#39;ve done some solid work.&#34;

The man looked at his colleague and sighed. Then tilted his head.

&#34;I mean, I don&#39;t know,&#34; his colleague continued. &#34;A lot of great stuff gets swept under the rug here, absorbed into bigger projects, or just forgotten under a pile of more noteworthy publications. If we wanted to be rock stars, the Foundation wasn&#39;t an ideal employer.&#34;

The man nodded.

&#34;I think it’s time,&#34; he finally said.

&#34;Time?&#34;

&#34;Time.&#34;

His colleague frowned and looked down at the floor in thought. 

&#34;I guess I&#39;ve got to at least ask why.&#34;

The man looked around. His chair made a few revolutions.

&#34;There is just not a lot here for me anymore.&#34; The man shrugged.

&#34;Bullshit. I know for a fact you&#39;re constantly publishing. Synth orders come in all the time.&#34;

The man shook his head. 

&#34;That&#39;s not what I meant.&#34;

&#34;Christ, Jake, what the hell did you mean then?&#34;

&#34;Look around you, Roland. Everyone&#39;s left.&#34;

The man counted on his fingers. 

&#34;Zach. Ed. Jean. Dan. Rose. Hell, even Adileh and Arvind went their own ways. This was never about the fame, Roland. This was always about the people I worked with. They made the job tolerable. Enjoyable, even. And they helped me through a lot of tough spots.&#34;

His colleague closed his eyes and nodded.

&#34;I&#39;m still here though,&#34; he said in a low voice. &#34;I&#39;ll notice if you leave.&#34;

&#34;That&#39;s part of what makes this so hard.&#34;

His colleague &#39;s lips briefly curved up.

&#34;What the hell will you even do once you&#39;re gone? Golf?&#34;

&#34;I don&#39;t know. Spend more time with Kate. Spend more time with Zach and Carrie. Maybe there is more for me to do here. Maybe not. But it’s time to put a signature on the damn thing and walk away before my wheels spin too much.&#34;

The man then stood and offered a handshake. His colleague accepted.

&#34;You&#39;re a good man, Roland,&#34; he said. &#34;The best friend I ever had. Promise me you&#39;ll look after the place.&#34;

&#34;I can&#39;t imagine anyone will do more damage to it than you did,&#34; his colleague chuckled.

A final pause.

&#34;You&#39;re shit at goodbyes, you know that.&#34;

&#34;Kate&#39;s said as much. Maybe that&#39;s something I can work on.&#34;</textarea></pre>
