**Item #:** SCP-3346

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3346 requires no unusual containment procedures beyond a standard containment locker in Site-19. Testing is to be approved by SCP-3346&#39;s primary researcher.

**Description:** SCP-3346 is a plastic child-size hard hat. The hat is a toy manufactured by the █████ Company in 1986 and is not suitable to be used as protective equipment. SCP-3346 shows signs of wear consistent with gentle use. There is a piece of yellow construction paper taped to the inside dome of SCP-3346 (see addendum 1).

When an individual puts SCP-3346 on their head, they experience a non-sight-based sensation. These sensations are related to significant anxieties the subject wearing SCP-3346 experienced as a child between the ages of 4-6. Frequently these are audio or physical sensations; however, no one in the experimentation chamber but the subject is able to experience the sensation. After removal of SCP-3346, most subjects report feeling much better about the incident and able to handle further exposure to the anxiety-inducing event.

**Experimentation Log:** Approval for testing using individuals under the age of 18 is pending. All testing until such a measure is approved is to be done by adults. Testing is to be conducted by instructing the subject to wear SCP-3346 for 60 seconds, then remove and offer commentary on their experience.

&gt; **Test Subject:** D-84269
&gt; **Testing:** D-84269 puts on SCP-3346. Subject looks confused, then at 34 seconds begins laughing. Subject removes SCP-3346 at 60 seconds.
&gt; **Commentary:** &#34;Macaroni salad! I tasted macaroni salad! God, I hated macaroni salad when I was a kid, it scared me to death! I thought it was little worms!&#34;
&gt; **Long-term Results:** D-84269 was provided with a bowl of macaroni salad and immediately began to eat it. Following consumption, D-84269 commented, &#34;I haven&#39;t thought about the worms thing in years. Isn&#39;t that funny? It was so serious back then.&#34;

&gt; **Test Subject:** Dr. Theodora Wu
&gt; **Testing:** Dr. Wu wears SCP-3346 for 60 seconds, then removes.
&gt; **Commentary:** &#34;I could smell flowers. My sister died when I was four, she was eight.&#34; (Pause) &#34;They covered her coffin in flowers. I had a panic attack at the funeral. I still can&#39;t stand dahlias, they were her favorite.&#34;
&gt; **Long-term Results:** Dr. Wu self-reported increased visits to R████████ Cemetary where her sister is buried. Most recent report indicated Dr. Wu brought dahlias with her, as &#34;They //were// her favorite.&#34;

&gt; **Test Subject:** Dr. Charles L. (request to remain anonymous)
&gt; **Testing:** Dr. L. was chosen as his psychological profile indicated being raised in an abusive household. He is instructed to wear SCP-3346 for the full 60 seconds. Dr. L. wears SCP-3346 for 60 seconds, displaying extreme discomfort throughout, then removes and throws across the room.
&gt; **Commentary:** Dr. L. was initially unable to respond to researcher queries, but after calming down claimed he &#34;felt him hit me again.&#34; Dr. L. was overcome again and unable to elaborate.
&gt; **Long-term Results:** Dr. L. was issued weekly Foundation-sponsored therapy and has been able to face some of the difficulties he endured as a child. When asked, Dr. L. commented, &#34;It&#39;s hard. It&#39;s going to take time. But I&#39;m glad I&#39;m facing it.&#34;

[[collapsible show=&#34;Addendum 3346-1&#34; hide=&#34;Access Granted&#34;]]
**Addendum 3346-1:** SCP-3346 was discovered with the following note taped inside. It is written on yellow construction paper using a blue crayon.

&gt; Worry Hat, Worry Hat
&gt; 
&gt; Worry Hat, Worry Hat
&gt; When it&#39;s hard to play
&gt; We can tell the Worry Hat
&gt; &#34;I feel sad today.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone can take their sad
&gt; And put it in the hat
&gt; Then when we are feeling good
&gt; We can come right back!
&gt; 
&gt; Mrs. Raymond&#39;s Kindergarten
&gt; If found please return!
