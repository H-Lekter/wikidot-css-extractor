&gt; We&#39;re finally leaving for the trip. It&#39;s been a hell of a ride getting here, but now we have it. A whole summer on the road. Nothing in our way but the freedom to ride the bends, turning wherever we feel like whenever we feel like. Rusty has his dad&#39;s wrecked up old Chevy for us to ride in, and he&#39;s gonna be driving.

&gt; First day of the drive, and I&#39;m pumped. We got Rusty in front, Lee in the passenger seat, with me and Andy chilling in the back. It&#39;s pretty nice. First place we&#39;re hitting up is the Black Ridge Rockstravaganza. I remember going here, it was amazing. Really what opened me up for my interest in rock.
&gt; 
&gt; Everyone is going to have a blast, Cindy and Lee are real pumped up for it. I hope they don&#39;t end up passed out drunk on the field again.

&gt; Driving down every road in Ohio must get boring after awhile, but Rusty manages to keep us going. I remember him telling all these wise-ass remarks about passing landmarks and people... But that was only when we&#39;re in the city. This is farmland.
&gt; 
&gt; I can&#39;t right write now, my head is blah

&gt; On the rooooooad again, i remembere the roooads again


&gt; We must be lost. I don&#39;t recall ever having been stuck this long without seeing an open road, or a turn, or even another house. All we get is one straight, flat road, stretching on for what seems like ages. God, this is turning out to be a less than stellar opening to our last memorable summer.

&gt; Rusty is an idiot. The first house we see for days, and he bolts by it. Apparently he had bad memories about the place, or some other hippie bullshit like that. You can&#39;t fucking have memories of shit you never saw. Then he has the nerve to not let anyone else drive, because he&#39;s supposed to be the driver.
&gt; 
&gt; wait, I forgot. Did Lee ever drive...

&gt; We left Rusty here today. When we came back he was gone

&gt; The car is longer now. I don&#39;t know how, but I do. The lights in my teeth are getting brighter, and the eyes of my light are brighter. I&#39;m sharp.
