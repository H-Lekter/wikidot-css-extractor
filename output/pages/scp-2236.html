[[include component:image-block name=SCP-2236.jpg|caption=SCP-2236]]

**Item #:** SCP-2236

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2236 is to be stored in its pouch (pictured) when not in use.  The pouch containing SCP-2236 is to be stored in an airtight humidity-controlled and temperature-controlled case.  To prevent security breaches, use of SCP-2236 must be approved by the administrator of Site 32.

**Addendum:** Under no circumstances is SCP-2236 to be brought into the presence of any internal Foundation memoranda or documents, including its own containment records.

**Description:**  SCP-2236 is a cylindrical optical instrument which superficially resembles an early-model pocket microscope.  The instrument is 11.6 cm in length, 1.9 cm in diameter, and has a planoconvex lens at each end with very slight convexity.  One end is equipped with an eyepiece; the other end is flanged at an angle.  The lenses and the body of the instrument enclose an airtight chamber between the lenses.  This chamber is filled with a faintly phosphorescent gas which has not been analyzed.

When a written document is observed through SCP-2236, the content of the text that is examined appears different to the observer.  See testing log.

**Testing Log:**

Please record all test results using the format below:
**Researcher | Date of test:**
**Text:**
**Result:**

------

**Researcher | Date of Test:**  Dr. Patel | 08-██-██
**Text:** Standard sheet of A4 writing paper with the text &#34;THIS IS A TEST&#34; printed in black 72-point type.
**Result:** Text appeared as &#34;LET&#39;S START WITH SOMETHING SIMPLE.&#34;  In this test and all subsequent tests, text appeared to have a lettering size and typeface or handwriting consistent with the sample under investigation.

**Text:** Standard sheet of A4 writing paper with the text &#34;Hello world.&#34; printed in black 72-point type.
**Result:**  Text appeared as &#34;I wonder if they restocked the good cookies in the vending machine.&#34;

**Text:** Standard sheet of A4 writing paper with the text &#34;This is a test&#34; handwritten by Dr. Garcia.  Dr. Garcia was not aware of SCP-2236 and was not involved in testing it apart from providing this sample to Dr. Patel without being informed of the purpose of the request.
**Result:** Text appeared as &#34;Piss off&#34; in Dr. Garcia&#39;s handwriting.

**Text:** Page 83 of &#34;The Spectacular Spignetti&#34;, a popular romance novel about circus acrobats that was found in the Site 32 break room.
**Result:** Excerpt of text: &#34;...all crap, but I need the money for Mitch&#39;s medicine.  And the pay sucks.  I have a master&#39;s degree from Williams and my advance comes out to, fuck, eight cents per page?  At least nobody will know...&#34;

**Text:** Page of instruction manual for coffee maker found in break room.
**Result:** Excerpt of text: &#34;... it was a mistake for me to leave the farm and come to Hangzhou ...&#34;

**Text:** Sheet music for &#34;Imagine&#34;, by John Lennon.
**Result:** Score for &#34;Baa Baa Black Sheep&#34;, lyrics changed to mis-spelled expletives.

**Text:** Page of machine-generated random numbers
**Result:** No change

**Text:** Page 22 of the first edition of &#34;For Whom the Bell Tolls&#34;
**Result:** A graphic description of an amorous encounter with a chambermaid in the Hotel Ambos-Mundos in Havana, Cuba.

**Text:** Printout of the text of a Wikipedia article on &#34;History of chemistry&#34;
**Result:** Barely-coherent text, apparently expressing several contradictory arguments concerning the themes discussed in the document interspersed with unflattering personal impressions of many of its draftsmen.

**Text:** Clay tablet, dated to c. 19th century BCE, inscribed with text in Akkadian cuneiform.  Text is a receipt for a cartload of wool.
**Result:** Text in Akkadian cuneiform, expressing delight over the high price paid for the wool, and mentioning the narrator&#39;s need to evacuate his bowels.

**Text:**  Page from Voynich manuscript
**Result:** Untranslated text with different glyphs in the same writing system.

**Text:**  Abstract of scientific journal article on microbiology
**Result:** Text describing the early stages of planning a wedding, interspersed with surprise and pleasure that &#34;Rick&#34; had proposed to the narrator. 

**Text:** Screenplay of █████ ████████, a major studio motion picture widely considered to be a commercial and critical failure
**Result:** A projected studio income statement in which the ticket and merchandising revenue streams from the film are drastically overestimated

**Text:** Photograph of the unsolved Zodiac Killer cypher
**Result:** Address of a residence in Vallejo, California.

**Text:** Text of Quranic sura &#34;//Yusuf//&#34; in classical Arabic
**Result:** Unchanged, except for immaterial spelling and punctuation variations.

**Text:** Ball-point pen scribblings by Dr. Patel&#39;s four-year-old daughter
**Result:** Architectural specifications for a three-story castle-like building to be constructed out of cupcakes and various confectionery items.  Engineering analysis has determined that the structure is unstable and unsuited for its specified purpose of housing a &#34;unicorn princess&#34;.

**Text:** Several pages of output produced by [[[SCP-887]]].
**Result:** Pages are blank

**Text:** &#34;Time Cube&#34; essay by Gene Ray
**Result:** Well-reasoned critique of generally-accepted theories of temporal physics.

**Text:** Press release in Korean by North Korea&#39;s Rodong Sinmun entitled &#34;Kim Jong-un Provides Field Guidance to Chonji Lubricant Factory&#34;
**Result:** Korean text structured as a dialogue between two interlocutors, debating the proper temperature at which kimchi is to be served. The narrative bears evidence that both debaters&#39; text was aggressively edited by a third person for unknown purposes.

**Researcher|Date:** Dr. Lock|20-██-██

**Text:** Mastering the art of French Cooking by Julia Child (page 78)
**Result:** Excerpt of text &#34;...and maybe it could use little salt here and there but it can be served like it is right now.&#34;

**Researcher|Date:** Dr. Califano|21-██-██

**Text:** Card from [[[SCP-2203]]], Test A-67
**Result:** Card appears covered in various technical specifications, including levels of various hormones over time, physiognometric analysis of various body and facial features, chronological history of life events, and interspersed commentary: &#34;Why did you hurt her?&#34; &#34;No one is better off with you since you keep acting like that.&#34; &#34;[[[SCP-517|Grammie still knows best.]]]&#34;
