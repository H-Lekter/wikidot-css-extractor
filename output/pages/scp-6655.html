]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the massive size of the various instances of SCP-6655, transport to a secure containment site is currently not possible. In light of this difficulty, a research site has been built around the locus of SCP-6655, designated Provisional Research Site 134 (henceforth referred to as PRS-134). A perimeter is to be maintained around PRS-134 no less than 25km from the site, and all access to airspace within 200km is to be restricted to Foundation-approved aircraft only. Stationed Task Force Omicron-18 &#34;Desert Rats&#34; has been founded in order to patrol the security perimeter of PRS-134.

**Description:** SCP-6655 is a large area in Central Australia, roughly 240km^^2^^, containing instances of SCP-6655-A and SCP-6655-B. SCP-6655 is devoid of all native multicellular life, and single-celled organisms are exceedingly rare. Population density of microorganisms is only 3% of the average for the environment in which SCP-6655 is located. The cause of this desolation is currently unknown, although it has been theorized that SCP-6655 was, at some point in the past, highly radioactive. Radiological dating of the surrounding soil, as well as bone samples from SCP-6655-B instances, date back roughly 225 MYA (million years ago), just before the Permian extinction[[footnote]]Advanced dating methods later revealed the area of SCP-6655 to coincide exactly with the Permian extinction. 
 [[/footnote]].
 
SCP-6655-A is the collective designation for all large-scale robotic entities found within SCP-6655. They are of massive size, with the average height of recorded instances being 1.3km. Explorations into SCP-6655-A have revealed a hollow interior to many of instances, with control interfaces and viewing screens present within. These  interfaces do not match any terrestrial or extraterrestrial devices of a similar nature known to the Foundation. The outer plating of many instances of SCP-6655-A are constructed of a Titanium-Iron-Cobalt-Aluminum alloy. Notable exceptions include SCP-6655-A-7 and SCP-6655-A-15. Efforts to reproduce this material have so far been unsuccessful. This alloy is extremely durable, with its upper limits of resistance to ablation, tearing and denting not yet known. Further study is recommended to learn the manufacturing process of this material. Despite the high durability of this material, all instances of SCP-6655-A are heavily damaged, with large tooth and claw marks matching the bite radius and claw patterns of various instances of SCP-6655-B. 

SCP-6655-B is the collective designation for all large-scale organic remains found within SCP-6655. The average height of these specimens is 1.5km. From data gathered from bone structure, all instances of SCP-6655-B appear to be reptilian in nature, although of an unknown genus[[footnote]]No other species similar to SCP-6655-B appear in the fossil record.[[/footnote]]. Despite being reptilian, many instances show unusual adaptations not found anywhere else in reptiles, such as SCP-6655-B-21, which sports a heavily armored carapace surrounding its entire body. All instances of SCP-6655-B show fatal wounds matching weapons wielded by SCP-6655-A. This damage, along with equally devastating damage to SCP-6655-A seems to indicate a battle occurred between SCP-6655-A and SCP-6655-B. Further exploration is recommended.

**Addendum:** Following Expedition 6655-1, all personnel with the exception of D-Class personnel used for testing must be equipped with a Scranton Reality Anchor at all times within any instance of SCP-6655-A.

For the purposes of this experiment, D-29687 was equipped with a crash helmet, flashlight, short-wave radio and 10m of climbing rope. D-29687 is a 28 year old male of Asian descent, with signs of aggressive tendencies and mild sociopathy.
/begin log
&gt; Dr. Langdon: This is Dr. Langdon and my wife, Dr. Amelia Wu. Test log 6655-1 commencing. D-Class subject designated D-29687 will enter SCP-6655-A-10.
&gt; Dr Wu: All right, D. You&#39;re good to go.
&gt; D-29687 (hereafter referred to as D): Whatever, doc. Just tell me when to get back out again.
 D enters a breach in SCP-6655-A-10&#39;s outer plating
&gt; D: So what am I looking for? Some weird shit or am I in here for nothing?
&gt; Dr. Langdon: There&#39;s an explanation for everything, D. Your job is to find the explanation for this SCP, and I suggest you find something useful.
&gt; D: All right, sure, Langdon. Now let&#39;s-

 At this point, radio contact is lost for 25 minutes. D refused to speak for 35 seconds, even after contact was reestablished.

&gt; D: Holy shit... holy shit... holy shit...
&gt; Dr. Langdon: D! What the hell is going on in there? Why did you turn off your radio?
&gt; D: I didn&#39;t! I lost contact and I- oh man...
&gt; Dr. Wu: D? Are you all right?
&gt; D: (loudly) I&#39;m fine!
&gt; Dr. Langdon: It&#39;s okay, D. Just tell us what you saw. Calmly.
&gt; D: So I lost contact, and then this... centipede-looking thing just came out of the wall. It was huge, the size of my arm. It had this look to it, it looked exactly like a living thing, but it was a robot, I could tell. This green light came out the front of it, and it made noises. Like a language, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s any language from earth.
&gt; Dr. Langdon: Hm. That explains a lot. Keep going, D.
&gt; D: No way, doc. That shit freaked me out.
&gt; Dr. Wu: I get, it, D. I really do. But we have to know what&#39;s going on because if we don&#39;t we might put innocent people in danger.
&gt; D: [EXPLETIVE REMOVED] innocent people! They can all die for all I care!
&gt; Dr. Langdon: D, I swear if you don&#39;t keep moving I will march you through that thing myself.
&gt; D: Okay, okay.

 Radio Contact is lost for another 15 minutes, 34 seconds. D appears at a small breach in the side of SCP-6655-A-10, which is not large enough to provide ingress or egress.

&gt; D: Doc, hand me a camera or something. You gotta see this.
&gt; Dr. Langdon: Oh? What did you find?
&gt; D: I can&#39;t really explain it. Just hand me a camera.

 D&#39;s request is granted, and he is handed a portable camera which streams to a nearby computer monitor. The image on this monitor reveal remains of unknown body plan, which have degraded to only a partial skeleton.

&gt; D: This is what I was talking about. I&#39;ll keep going.

 D walks in silence for another 30 minutes

&gt; D: Wait, what&#39;s that noise.

 A sharp, shrill sound can be heard.

&gt; D: What is tha- (D screams)[[footnote]]Automated security systems within SCP-6655-A-10 rapidly decrease the internal Hume levels of a selected target to less than 0.5% of normal levels, causing immediate atomic disintegration. Following this discovery, Site Director Hrolfsson enacted Exploration Directive 6655-BRAVO.[[/footnote]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;Show exploration log of Expedition 6655-2&#34; hide=&#34;Collapse text&#34;]] 
 For this expedition, 3 members of MTF Zeta-9 &#34;Mole Rats&#34; were requisitioned to explore SCP-6655-A-10, codenamed &#34;Scarface&#34; (Team leader/ Demolitionist), &#34;Wildman&#34;(Assault specialist) and &#34;Oddball&#34;(Combat medic/ Equipment officer). Zeta-9 was deployed with intent to discover more of the origins of the ship, and recover any physical evidence possible

/begin log
&gt; Oddball: Hey Zeke, ever been inside a giant robot before?
&gt; Wildman: Nah, but remember that creepy old ship?
&gt; Scarface: Cut the chatter, you two. And Oddball, on mission his name is Wildman, I don&#39;t care how well you know each other.
&gt; Oddball: Okay, boss.
&gt; Scarface: Langdon, do you read?
&gt; Dr. Langdon: Loud and clear, Scarface. Bring us back something we can use and I&#39;ll buy you a scotch when you get back.
&gt; Scarface: Thanks, doc.

 Radio contact is lost almost immediately upon entering the structure

&gt; Wildman: That complicates things. How&#39;s our gear, Oddball?
&gt; Oddball: Reality anchors strong and steady. Check your weapons.
&gt; Wildman: We checked them before we went in, that&#39;s protocol.
&gt; Oddball: Never hurts to double check.
&gt; Scarface: We don&#39;t have time for this. Move out.
&gt; Oddball: Killjoy.

 Zeta-9 proceeds with no delays for another 30 minutes. At this, time, they reach a sealed blast door.

&gt; Scarface: I&#39;m betting something important is behind that door. Let&#39;s crack it open the old-fashioned way.
&gt; Wildman: I love the old-fashioned way.

 A breaching charge is set

&gt; Wildman: Okay, stand back.

 The charge is detonated, but appears to have no effect

&gt; Scarface: That&#39;s new. If an area is this well-protected it must be important. Grab a cutting torch.

 After 15 minutes, the door is successfully breached

 Automated defenses are activated, and directed energy projectiles are launched at Zeta-9 from three automated security turrets[[footnote]]It has been theorized that these turrets were not programmed to recognize a humanoid body plan, leading to a significant decrease in accuracy.[[/footnote]]

&gt; Scarface: Take cover!
&gt; Oddball: Son of a [EXPLETIVE REMOVED] !
&gt; Wildman: Well, don&#39;t just sit there! Shoot back!

 Zeta-9 opens fire, destroying two turrets and disabling a third

&gt; Scarface: Wildman, run this back outside to Langdon and Wu. They&#39;re gonna want to see it.
&gt; Wildman: On it, boss.

 The intact turret is retrieved for analysis

&gt; Scarface: Oddball, you&#39;re with me.
&gt; Oddball: Copy.

 Multiple terminals of unknown design are present within the room

&gt; Oddball: Ever seen anything like this?
&gt; Scarface: No way. 

 The same sound that was present at the moment of D&#39;s termination reappears

&gt; Oddball: Argh! What the hell is that noise!
&gt; Scarface: I feel funny. Let&#39;s get out of here.
&gt; Oddball: Hang, on. I&#39;m going to try to collect some data from these terminals

 Oddball successfully transfers 88GB of data to her PDA

&gt; Oddball: Well, I&#39;ll be damned. Let&#39;s move!

 Scarface and Oddball regroup with Wildman outside SCP-6655-A-10 without further incident

[[tab Notable Instances of SCP-6655]]

**SCP-6655-A-1:** The first instance of SCP-6655 discovered. This instance closely resembles the remains found within SCP-6655-A instances, on a massive scale. It appears to be designed for quick movement.

**SCP-6655-A-10:** This instance is noticeably humanoid in shape, suggesting that the entities who built and operated SCP-6655-A have had previous contact with entities of a similar body plan. 

**SCP-6655-A-13:** Hume levels inside this instance are dangerously low. This, along with unusual damage to the armor plating, suggests it was disabled by a reality-warping attack.

**SCP-6655-A-15:** This instance is a large sphere, much smaller than other instances at only 267m across. Data recovered within SCP-6655-A-15 suggest it formed a bubble of energy around itself which it could manipulate to form limbs and weapons. Further research is recommended.

**SCP-6655-B-3:** This instance is 1.2km in length and stands 587m high. It possesses eight legs and noticeable gills arches preserved on it&#39;s neck. It&#39;s teeth are flat and blunt, suggesting it had adapted specifically to crush metal structures.

**SCP-6655-B-12:** This instance possesses a mummified internal organ of unknown function. Hume levels surrounding its remains are in constant flux, suggesting powerful reality-warping abilities.

**SCP-6655-B-21:** As previously mentioned, this instance possesses a hard carapace, several meters in thickness. It is also notable for possessing three brains spaced evenly down its back.

**SCP-6655-B-27:** This instance possesses four large brains throughout its body, suggesting extremely high intelligence. Evidence also suggest reality-warping abilities powerful enough for intergalactic and possibly even interdimensional travel.
