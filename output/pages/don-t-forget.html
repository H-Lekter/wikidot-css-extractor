&gt; This letter is to anyone who remembers that one should always take care of their fellow man.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;m stuck in this little room surrounded by a big layer of concrete. I usually can&#39;t open the door because it locks from the other side. Sometimes people leave the door opened and I leave, but when I try to get someone to help me, nobody will pay any attention to me. I can try hitting them, knocking their stuff over, screaming at them, but they&#39;ll just keep going about their business like I don&#39;t even exist. Sometimes I try to run away, but when I get outside my head starts hurting, and then I get really tired. When I go to sleep, I wake up back in that intolerable room, locked in and forgotten. Again.
&gt; 
&gt; Sometimes people come into my room. We talk, and they&#39;re usually very surprised to see me. They always promise to get me help. They take lots of notes and photos so they don&#39;t forget me, but they always do. Lately, it&#39;s been a bunch of scientists in lab coats. You would think that a scientist would have a better memory then those other guys who came before them, but they forget about me like all the rest.
&gt; 
&gt; If you find this letter, and you come into my room, please don&#39;t leave me in there. Take me with you so we can make people see me. Make them see I exist.
&gt; 
&gt; Please.
