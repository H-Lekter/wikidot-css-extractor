A nice little story about Lily&#39;s Proposal, and three events relating to it.

[[/=]]
[[include :scp-wiki:info:end]]
[[=]]
The emaciated man crawled out of his hole in the ground. For the first time in what could&#39;ve been aeons, the man felt the Sun&#39;s heat on his pallid skin. Underneath his boney fingers, he felt the soft pasture caressing his hands. Amongst the grass, the man sensed something else.

The man grabbed the something, pulling it out of the ground. He felt it, smelled it, licked it, curious to what it may be. His chapped lips slowly formed a smile as he realized what he held.

[[[lily-s-proposal |It was a Lily]]].

Though his eyes had stopped working long ago, he knew what was around him. A field of flowers, covering every inch of dirt, as far as the eye could see. His lungs moved for the first time in years as he let out a weak laugh, tears moisturizing his dry and dull lips. He knew what this meant.

He knew, without a shadow of a doubt, that he was [[[scp-2165 |redeemed.]]]

As the white birds flew overhead, a group of scientists nervously moved about. They entered the Keter Wing, holding on tightly to their keycards. They had been given orders, straight from the Overseer&#39;s desk. They weren&#39;t sure if they wanted to carry them out, but orders are orders.

They reached the containment chamber, and filed into the observation room. Some of them began to pray, while others just nervously smiled. Three of them pulled out their keys, inserted them into the panel, and turned them.

As the acid began to drain, some researchers began to laugh, and others broke out into tears. Once the last of the acid flowed out of the room, the men turned their keys a second time. The men watched on as the chamber&#39;s doors, connecting it to the outside world, began to let light in. 682 slowly got up from the floor, awakened by the sun&#39;s light. It made its ways through the opening, out into the wider world. Some of the researchers left the observation room and stepped into 682&#39;s old cell, curious to see what the old reptile would do.

The reptilian looked around for a bit, staring at the beautiful birds overhead. For the moment, the researchers held their breath, fearful this monster would jump up and snatch the doves out of the sky. Instead, it looked back down, before plopping down on a bed of flowers and letting out a heavy sigh. It seemed...

Satisfied.

In a [[[end-of-death-hub |deathless]]] world...

It was a Saturday evening. It wasn&#39;t any special day, or a special year for that matter. For many, it was just another year, another decade in an endless pandemonium.

That - The boredom with no end in sight, the monotony of a life without death - all of that, changed when the flowers blossomed. [[[new-buteo-series-mechanical-exoskeleton |Anderson&#39;s robobodies]]] offered some escape from it all, but this? To know, in just 24 hours, all of the pain would be over? It was a blessing from up above.

The Foundation looked deep into their records, having long discarded CODENAME: Lily as a possibility. The doves that they had prepared for it were far too old, their muscles having atrophied a hundred years ago. Parties ran rampant throughout the organisation&#39;s facilities, its staff beyond ecstatic for their demise.

The same could be said for the rest of the world. Festivals were held throughout the world, and many prepared for the end. They got their personal items ready, dressed up in their favourite suits and dresses and what-have-you. News outlets ran national betting contests, with millions of participants speculating on how they would go out. For the first time in centuries, the world was happy, and they definitely showed it.

The world went out not with a whimper, but with a bang.
