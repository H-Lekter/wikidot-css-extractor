**Item #:** SCP-4563

**Object Class:** Thaumiel

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to SCP-4563&#39;s vast knowledge in the field of Psychotherapy, the Foundation recognizes SCP-4563 as Foundation personnel, and is to be treated as such. SCP-4563 is currently working within a standard office located in the West Wing of Site 17. Any personnel currently working at Site 17 are allowed to book sessions with SCP-4563 if they so choose. Any low threat humanoid entity contained at Site 17, recommended to see a Psychiatrist should be assigned to SCP-4563 for scheduled sessions. The topics SCP-4563 and its patients discuss are protected by Client Confidentiality, and are not to be logged or documented.

SCP-4563 has been granted Level 3 Clearance to access restricted files and areas of the site in order to provide information to SCP-4563 on the various anomalous entities SCP-4563 works with, such as [[[SCP-1846|SCP-1846]]] and [[[SCP-007|SCP-007]]].

SCP-4563 is authorized to prescribe medication for patients, but is no longer allowed to prescribe //Reboxetine//[[footnote]] An antidepressant used for the treatment of major depression.[[/footnote]] due to its negative effects. Because of SCP-4563&#39;s physical appearance, it is recommended that potential patients with katsaridaphobia[[footnote]] Fear of cockroaches. [[/footnote]] should not receive therapy from SCP-4563.

**Description:** SCP-4563 is a American Brown Cockroach (//Periplaneta americana//) that measures roughly 2 meters in height, excluding antennae. The subject has a preference for blue, pinstripe suits and a blue bowler hat. All of these clothes have been modified to accommodate additional appendages. This is often accompanied by a badge labeled “Dr. Barnabas P. Lockwood”. SCP-4563 has scored &#34;high&#34; on the empathy quotient test, and appears to be psychologically stable. ##red|The subject is unable to see the color red. Information that is classified to it is shaded as such.##

Its physical form occasionally degrades into a group of American Brown Cockroaches (//Periplaneta americana//); however, this is considered rare enough that it is of no concern. ##red|This will happen, do not worry.## The subject has shown itself to be trustworthy to the degree where it has been determined they would benefit the Foundation if it is instated as an ##red|unpaid## employee. Continued good behavior has been rewarded with higher-profile patients, as SCP-4563 has expressed interest in diversifying its profile. 

Post-appointment, patients are to receive the following questionnaire:

&gt; **Post-session psychological evaluation:**
