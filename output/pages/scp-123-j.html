**Item #:** SCP-123-J

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Any instances of SCP-123-J are to be contained within the staff refrigerator at Site ██. Staff use is allowed; however, staff are warned that ingestion of SCP-123-J and subsequent information of its composition can result in shock, paranoia, and a healthier lifestyle.

If personnel come across an instance of SCP-123-J, they are to purchase it and preferably some instances of SCP-123-J-2.

**Description:** SCP-123-J-1 is a small plastic tub with the brand label “I Can&#39;t Believe It&#39;s Not Butter” on its cover. Investigation has been made into Becel company, creators of &#34;I Can&#39;t Believe It&#39;s Not Butter&#34;; however, no links to any occult organizations have been found. 

Contained within SCP-123-J-1 is a compound of oils forming into an edible substance, designated SCP-123-J. When a subject spreads SCP-123-J on any grain product and ingests it, they report SCP-123-J to have a taste similar to butter. When informed that the substance is not organic butter, subjects typically report disbelief.

SCP-123-J melts when exposed to heat higher than room temperature. When left refrigerated SCP-123-J slowly solidifies into its original, spreadable state.

SCP-123-J was originally purchased by Agent C█████ in a Safeway supermarket located in ██████, Maryland. Upon ingesting it through the use of a SCP-123-J-2, the Agent handed SCP-123-J to Agent F███, urging confirmation that the substance was butter. Agent F███ ingested the remaining portion of SCP-123-J-2 and alerted the Foundation. Although initially suspected of misinformation, Agents C█████ and F███ were later promoted.

**Addendum 123-J-A:**

**Interview 123-J-A**

&gt; **Interviewed:** D-6539
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. █████
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** D-6539 had just ingested SCP-123-J after it was spread upon an instance of SCP-123-J-2
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████:** How are you feeling?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-6539:** Like I have obtained my recommended amount of nutrients and vitamins, and all at a very low price! 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████:** What if I told you SCP-123-J was not butter?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-6539:** Really? (Turns to Security Camera 1) I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s not butter!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████:** (Lets out small chuckle) That&#39;s right, SCP-123-J is actually composed of vegetable oils. Without the addition of all that pesky saturated fat you find in organic butter, you can trust SCP-123-J to deliver the flavor you&#39;re used to, but with a lower price and a healthier heart!
&gt; 
&gt; **D-6539:** Wow!
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Although D-6539 was still sent in for month-end termination, he did so with the confidence that he had reduced his cholesterol intake to a healthy standard thanks to SCP-123-J.</textarea></pre>
