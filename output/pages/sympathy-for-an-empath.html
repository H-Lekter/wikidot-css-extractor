I miss the children.

I miss them so much.

I miss Janey and Jake and David and Roxanne.

These people are alright, I suppose. They&#39;re not the kids, but I like them anyways. I guess I should be grateful, really. They gave me a new home after the Doctor threw me away.

I love them.

I want to make them happy. Mommy always told me to be a happy girl, didn&#39;t she?  I want to show them how much I really appreciate how much they&#39;re done for me. It&#39;s so, so incredibly nice what they do.

I just wish I could talk to them.

Of course, I can&#39;t. I&#39;d need vocal cords to do that. Lungs, too. Heh, I don&#39;t even have a mouth most days. Even when I do, I can&#39;t use it. Not even to introduce myself. &#34;Hi, my name is Leo, thank you so much for saving me, blah, blah, blah...&#34; I&#39;m thankful anyways, though. It&#39;s nice to feel...normal, even if it&#39;s just for a short period of time. I miss being...being...

Cripes. I keep trying to remember that silly name. It doesn&#39;t matter, what&#39;s past is past and I can&#39;t change who I am. Yep yep, my name is unimportant anywa-- Oh wait. Silly me, it&#39;s Jake! Anyways, I really can&#39;t complain. I&#39;m a guest now! A guest to these wonderful people! It&#39;s not like much is different from the Warehouse and the Amaze-O-Sphere. All that&#39;s really changed is I&#39;m not allowed to be all there sometimes (which I don&#39;t mind), and I get taken out a little less. But that&#39;s okay! This place is my home now! These people will never throw me away!

Not like Wondertainment did.

...

...

I thought I was part of the family...I never thought they would...I never thought they would treat me like Redd...

They told me I was the Beta product...I was ready for shipment...

...I guess I didn&#39;t change right one day.

But that&#39;s okay. Because now I have this family! It&#39;s a lot less comfy than the bedroom with my brothers, but hey, it&#39;s better than the dump! Hahaha.

Yessiree, I gotta remember that happiness is the selling point! Always be positive! Mr. Shapey&#39;s still on the clock!</textarea></pre>
