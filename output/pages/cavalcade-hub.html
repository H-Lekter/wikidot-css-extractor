&gt; //The light of spring flowed from the sky,
&gt; and touched upon the Town.
&gt; When, from the mountains up on high,
&gt; the Troupe came marching down.//
&gt; 
&gt; //They rode on horses draped in red,
&gt; as well as green and white.
&gt; And on each covered, silent head,
&gt; gold bells danced in the light.//
&gt; 
&gt; //And when the townsfolk came to see
&gt; the strangers in their home,
&gt; the trav&#39;lers did remove their masks
&gt; and summoned forth a tome.//
&gt; 
&gt; //So they did speak, so they did tell
&gt; of things beyond compare.
&gt; Of stranger lands than Heav&#39;n or Hell
&gt; and creatures living there.//
&gt; 
&gt; //They spoke and spoke, and when one chose
&gt; to state that he was through,
&gt; then from her seat, another rose
&gt; and spoke words loud and true.//
&gt; 
&gt; //When each was done, they donned their masks
&gt; and climbed upon their beasts
&gt; and bade the horses double fast,
&gt; proceeding to the east.//
&gt; 
&gt; //And so the Troupe did leave the Town,
&gt; a new tradition made.
&gt; As all things start, so they wear down:
&gt; such is the **Cavalcade**.//

+ Welcome to Cavalcade!

A reasonable question you might have: **What in the gosh-dang heck is Cavalcade?**

According to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalcade Wikipedia]:

//A cavalcade is a procession or parade on horseback, or a mass trail ride by a company of riders. The focus of a cavalcade is participation rather than display. Often, the participants do not wear costumes or ride in formation. Often, a cavalcade re-enacts an important historical event and follows a long distance trail. A cavalcade may also be a pilgrimage.//

Of course, the question then is what we actually mean //here// when we&#39;re talking about Cavalcade. In the context of this page, **Cavalcade is a theoretically endless collaborative tale project**. The purpose of Cavalcade is to **explore the entire SCP universe**, not just bits and pieces of it. It is a heavily nonlinear project, with little to no advance planning of plot or stories. However, this allows for emergent, character-driven plotlines to evolve naturally, and hopefully be a fun collaborative writing experiment.

+ The Rules Of Cavalcade

**NOTE: This is a shortened summary of the rules; for a full length version, see the Sandbox page.**

**Rule 1:** Everyone who is writing for Cavalcade is put into a rotation. After one person completes their tale, the next person is picked in order from this pool. For one week after being picked, that author has absolute control over the next tale in the Cavalcade. They can do whatever they want in their tale, provided it doesn&#39;t violate the other rules below. Ideally, at least one Cavalcade story will get written every week!
**Rule 2:** Every tale must introduce at least one character who has not appeared in any previous tale in the Cavalcade.
**Rule 3:** Every character in Cavalcade has to be named.
**Rule 4:** No tale can include a character who has appeared in the previous two tales.
**Rule 5:** Every tale must include at least one character who has been used before in Cavalcade.
**Rule 6:** All stories must be at least 1000 words long.
**Rule 7:** At least one out of every three consecutive tales must include or reference a non-Foundation Group Of Interest (GOI).
**Rule 8:** At least one out of every three consecutive tales needs to include or reference an SCP.
**Rule 9:** Every Cavalcade tale must link to the Cavalcade Hub, the previous tale written, and the next tale.

That&#39;s it! Outside of these rules, anything goes.
