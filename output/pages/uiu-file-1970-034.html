[[size 120%]] **UIU File 1970-034:** Case File &#34;A Whale of a Time&#34;[[/size]]
**Summary:** A deceased juvenile //Balaenoptera musculus// (blue whale) beached on Heceta Beach in Florence, Oregon. The whale produced an explosive substance within its body cavities, with production persisting after death. UIU neutralization ceased production of the fluid.

[[tab Suspect Description/Capabilities]]

**Name:** N/A

**Irregularity Cross-reference:** Animal, Whale, Nonhostile, Deceased, Explosive

**Physical Description:** Corpse of //Balaenoptera musculus//, formerly severely decomposed.

||~ Sex ||~ Height ||~ Weight/Build ||~ Race ||~ Hair ||~ Eyes ||~ Identifying Attributes ||
|| Female || 45&#39; || 8 tons || N/A || N/A || N/A || Remains of a blue whale. ||

**Capabilities:** Production of explosive liquid, mostly ceased after immolation.

**Purpose/Motive:** Unknown/Survival

**Modus Operandi:** Small, porous, tumorous growths within alveoli and the stomach wall continually leaked the irregular substance through their pores. Dissection of these tumors have revealed the interiors filled with fatty tissues.

**Behavior:** The blue whale beached itself and asphyxiated from liquid production within lungs. The whale died an estimated twenty-five hours before discovery.

[[tab Evidence]]

**Piece of spinal column:** A  200-lb mass of vertabra from the entity was launched from the ignition of the liquid and landed on one Mr. Umenhofer&#39;s Cadillac. He was compensated for damages.

**Vial of liquid:** A corked vial full of the liquid produced by the entity. Testing has shown that it is chemically similar to  nitroglycerin and contains trace amounts of amino acid and DNA strands. The liquid has a higher explosive yield per gallon than typical nitroglycerin. 

**Tumor:** A three-pound tumor retrieved from the stomach of the whale. Is the only tumor retrieved that still produces the paranatural substance, albeit at a severely reduced rate of one teaspoon per day. Field use of the substance is to be limited, but the liquid is to be collected and stored for a later date.

**Video:** A [[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBgThvB_IDQ|recording of entity and neutralization]]] by civilian news sources. Captured footage shows the agents neutralizing the entity disguised as Department of Transportation employees. Due to funding issues around the time of the case, the UIU was unable to prevent the news stations from airing the broadcast, nor able to amnesticize the local populace.

[[tab Bureau Record]]

**Current Status:** Some of the skeleton was retrieved and donated to Wilson&#39;s Wildlife Solutions to act as an educational aquatic wildlife display. The rest of the harvested remains were placed in UIU cold storage.

**History of UIU Action:** 

//11/12/1970//

//7:00 AM:// A couple walking on the beach discovers the whale and calls the authorities.

//8:30 AM:// Fish and Wildlife Service Anomalous Detachment is notified about the paranatural occurrence, hands the case to the UIU.

//8:45 AM:// Five UIU agents stationed within Three Portlands are dispatched to investigate the potentially paranatural event.

//11:15 AM:// UIU agents arrive at the scene and attempt to cordon off the area. The civilians ignore the agents and news trucks arrive.

//11:20 AM:// Agent Thorton investigates the carcass and lights a cigarette. Ash from the cigarette lands in a puddle of the paranatural fluid, igniting. Thorton extinguishes the fire and collects a sample of the liquid. Paranatural manifestation is confirmed.

//12:10 PM:// Agents confirm death did not halt production of the fluid, and accumulation of the liquid will reach dangerous levels if not neutralized. Thorton suggests the detonation of the carcass. 

//12:30 PM:// Headquarters okays the use of several sticks of dynamite in the detonation of the entity, and civilians are evacuated to a safe distance.

//12:45 PM:// Whale detonated.

//12:46 PM:// Bones of the whale collided with roofs, fences, and one car after being launched a quarter of a mile from the explosion.

//12:50 PM:// Agents confirm production of the fluid has ceased, and leave the scene.
