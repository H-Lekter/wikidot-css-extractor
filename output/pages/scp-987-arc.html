At no point should SCP-987 be removed from this envelope except under the supervision of [NAME REDACTED, SEE ADDENDUM]. Following removal from its envelope, SCP-987 should only be opened by expendable Class D personnel.

Document #987-1: July 11, 1999 Summary Report on SCP-987

SCP-987 was found in a Saskatchewan farmhouse in 1997. The house’s residents were found sitting in front of it, armed, having apparently starved to death while looking through. The properties of SCP-987 were originally assumed to have been limited to its location in the north wall of the house’s living room. The anomaly was soon discovered to be contained between the double-paned glass itself. 

When looking “out” the window, one sees a living room furnished and decorated circa 1987. The room has been ransacked. Naked, bloodstained men and women pass through the room occasionally. While they ape normal human behaviour, no evidence has surfaced to support the hypothesis that they understand their behaviour or interact socially in a meaningful manner.
