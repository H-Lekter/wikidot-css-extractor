I&#39;ve never been one for in-universe author pages, so this is going to be my stuff, my commentary on said stuff, and nothing more.

This originally was a mainlist scip, which was simply the garbage can and the intended meaning. It suffered from anomalous object syndrome and note-at-the-end syndrome. General consensus at the time was that the idea was good, but it wasn&#39;t a mainlister. Over the course of several months, I tried to expand the idea, trying to turn it into an exploration log of anomalous art that was tossed in the garbage can.

The problem being that I&#39;m terrible with back-and-forth dialog. I&#39;m fine with monologs and the like, but I find it difficult to switch between multiple distinct points of view while maintaining any kind of flow.

It ended up being a goi-format, and my personal favorite work that I&#39;ve done so far. //Masoschism// was created to be the subject of Miller&#39;s ramblings, and it ended up being most of the page. Funnily enough, Miller&#39;s section was going to be much longer, but I got lazy and decided to publish it as-is. Turns out that made it better overall, since it was punchier and I was kinda overstaying my welcome at that point anyways.

There&#39;s not much to say about this one that I didn&#39;t say in my author post.

I don&#39;t regret writing the Factory Hub. I feel like every GOI should at some point get a hub, since they&#39;re far more prevalent than canons or tale series, and the tag cloud wikidot provides looks awful.

I regret writing it the way I did - i.e. placing emphasis on short blurbs describing different interpretations rather than distilling the Factory down to its most common and base elements and presenting those. Currently being rewritten by Scorpion451 to do just that.

&gt; Solid twist that manages to redeem an otherwise short and somewhat bland article.
&gt; ~ARD

I don&#39;t expect this to be anything that stays at a high rating, since I wrote it in ~1 hour. Contains a nod to a previous thing I wrote, and a nod to actual Lego history.

I&#39;ll probably try and retool this one at a later date, since there were a few things I left on the cutting room floor that I liked but couldn&#39;t find the words for.
