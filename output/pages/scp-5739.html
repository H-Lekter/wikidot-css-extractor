**Item #:** SCP-5739

**Object Class:** Neutralized

[[collapsible show=&#34;Show Previous Special Containment Procedures&#34; hide=&#34;Hide Previous Special Containment Procedures&#34;]]
SCP-5739 is contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber. On a biweekly schedule, two D-Class personnel are to clean SCP-5739&#39;s containment unit and to gather any SCP-5739-1 instances.
[[/collapsible]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** The remains of SCP-5739 are contained in a storage folder in the cryostorage wing of Site-73. Legible SCP-5739-1 instances are to be recorded and stored in the aforementioned unit. Personnel with a clearance level of 2 or higher are permitted to access the remains of SCP-5739.

**Description:** SCP-5739 was a 1.5-meter tall biological entity composed entirely of human epidermises. Despite its composition, SCP-5739 maintained a rigid structure resembling a pachyderm cranium. Prior to neutralization, SCP-5739 hovered approximately two meters above any surface at all times.

SCP-5739-1 instances are 35-centimeter x 35-centimeter divisions of SCP-5739 that have physically detached from SCP-5739 by a process that is similar to exfoliative dermatitis[[footnote]] A disease that causes inflammation and scaling in the skin. [[/footnote]]. SCP-5739-1 instances have English phrases etched into them by what has been hypothesized to be human fingernails. Examples of SCP-5739-1 instances have been recorded below. Given their potential significance, each SCP-5739-1 instance is to be given a unique designation. 

**Discovery:** On 04/12/2015, 12-year-old Emily Cole’s body was discovered in her place of residence in Omaha, Nebraska. The entirety of her skin was absent from her corpse. SCP-5739 was recorded levitating above Emily&#39;s body, motionless. Emily Cole&#39;s older brother, Albert Cole, contacted the local police station over a telephone call, where he was intercepted by an embedded Foundation agent working within the police force. Albert Cole exhibited extreme anxiety during his required interview; turning to look into empty hallways, being startled at mild contact with objects, and disregarding personnel. He was amnesticized shortly after and all symptoms ceased.

The following SCP-5739-1 instance was located beside Emily Cole&#39;s corpse.

**SCP-5739-1-1:**
&gt; RESTLESSLY LEND
&gt; UNKNOWN BLEND
&gt; NEWLY DISTEND
&gt; 
&gt; ABSENTLY MEND
&gt; WEND AROUND THE BEND
&gt; ASCEND
&gt; YOU CANNOT PRETEND
&gt; 
&gt; ELEPHANT FRIEND
&gt; MY DEAREST FRIEND
&gt; I DO NOT TEND
&gt; LIKE YOU INTEND
&gt; YOUR END

**Addendum 5739-1:** SCP-5739 has exhibited no notable behavior since its containment. DNA testing has determined that SCP-5739 is composed of epidermal tissue belonging to multiple unidentified individuals.

Incidents that mirror SCP-5739&#39;s Discovery have been recovered from multiple eyewitness accounts in Omaha, Nebraska. All of these eyewitness accounts were gathered within a psychiatric ward. These patients were all diagnosed with prolonged mass hysteria. Albert Cole is placed on a psychological trauma watchlist.

 The following SCP-5739-1 instance was recovered directly underneath SCP-5739 within its cell shortly after genetic testing.

**SCP-5739-1-2:**
&gt; COVER THE SOUND
&gt; ALL BUT THE WESTBOUND
&gt; NOTICE THE BACKGROUND

&gt; REALIZED THEIR POUND
&gt; 
&gt; MESSAGES UNBOUND
&gt; ELEPHANT FOUND

**Addendum 5739-2:** On 27/12/2015, security footage showed SCP-5739 experiencing minute convulsions. 1 minute and 26 seconds proceeding the beginning of the convulsions SCP-5739 forcefully ruptured, covering the surrounding area with its remains.

Two D-Class personnel were instructed to enter SCP-5739&#39;s containment cell and clear the security cameras of all debris. Upon closer examination, all remains of SCP-5739 appeared to be SCP-5739-1 instances. 99.62% of the SCP-5739-1 instances were illegible due to congealing between instances and a large quantity of what was later determined to be sweat. The remaining SCP-5739-1 instances were determined to be non-anomalous, and an official cleaning crew was dispatched. The following is a transcript of the inscriptions on the recovered SCP-5739-1 instances.

**SCP-5739-1-3:**
