//**I&#39;m going to preface this. This was written as a joke. You shouldn&#39;t take this as something to emulate. Having someone write something in the same vein would be embarrassing, and I&#39;d probably end up taking the story down. So please, as you read this, remember, it&#39;s not even CLOSE to possibly being canon.**//


Thomas lazed at the security desk. Fifteen minutes until his shift ended. Fifteen minutes until he could go get a drink, hit on that cute girl from maintenance. She looked like she sure knew her way around a wrench, and Thomas had a &#34;tool&#34; of his own for her to handl-

&#34;Uh, Pardon me. Can you tell me where the research labs are?&#34;

Thomas&#39; musings were interrupted by the sound of his genitalia retracting inside his body from sheer horror.

Floating in front of him, approximately four feet above the ground, was a fetus. A high pitched voice spoke again.

&#34;Normally I would know where it is, but I&#39;m a new transfer and your site is set up strangely. My name is Doctor Abortion.&#34;

&#34;Do-do-doctor what?!&#34;

&#34;Doctor Abortion. As you may imagine, my name is centered around my unusual appearance. Now, if you&#39;ll direct me to the research labs, I will be out of your hair.&#34;

Thomas wordlessly pointed. The fetus bobbed at him, and floated off.

Today, Thomas decided, was a good day to hide. Under his bed.

-----------------------

In the hallways, people stopped and stared. A female lab assistant screamed, and fainted. The fetus bobbing its way along the corridors took no notice. A tune was hummed, though, for the life of them, they couldn&#39;t understand how.

The abortion who floated like a butterfly and gave nightmares like an elder god paused in front of a door. A knock was heard, and boggled many a researcher.

Doctor Gerald poked his head out and stared.

&#34;Surprise, Daddy!&#34;

-----------------------

Thomas, hiding under his bed, shrank deeper into the darkness at the sound of a piercing scream.

-----------------------

&#34;But, but, but, but!&#34;

&#34;You transferred right after I started to show. Not trying to run on me, were you?&#34;

&#34;No! I didn&#39;t know! No one told me!&#34;

&#34;Probably because of the fear of me being captured. Most one-night-stand babies aren&#39;t this valuable.&#34;

&#34;So, you&#39;re sure it&#39;s me?&#34;

&#34;Yes, I am. They ran all sorts of tests on me. Still are, actually.&#34;

&#34;So, uh, what is the, uh...?&#34;

&#34;He&#39;s a healthy little boy.&#34;

&#34;What are we going to name it?&#34;

&#34;Oh, sticking around are we? Well, I was thinking...Claude. After me.&#34;</textarea></pre>
