I love Halloween. It&#39;s my favorite time of year, one of the few days I can just go out and mingle with the normal people for an entire night without anyone being the wiser. The pain&#39;s not so bad when I can change so often, it&#39;s dark with plenty of places to hide and change in secret, and the candy makes up for it.

There&#39;s an astronaut over there. I think I&#39;ll be an astronaut too now.

It&#39;s so easy, not at all like having to make up a shape and hold on to it, keeping it in my head and on my body until it hurts too much to bear. There&#39;s so many other people in costumes, I can just copy one of them and then I only need to keep the picture outside from changing.

That little boy is a pirate. I like pirates, I&#39;m going to be a pirate.

Oh, and the candy. I do so love candy, but the rest of the year, it&#39;s so hard to get. You need money to buy candy, and even if I could get money, I can&#39;t keep it, I always drop it when I change. So I have to steal it, and that&#39;s even harder, because even if I get some, I have to drop it too when I change to get away.

A ballerina? That could make a nice shape to be, I&#39;ll try that.

Tonight, you don&#39;t have to buy or steal candy, they just give it away. They don&#39;t like to give you candy more than once, but that&#39;s not a problem for me, not if I see someone I want to be and get to a house before they do. I can clean out a house in minutes if I&#39;m lucky, and have a whole bag of candy to go hide somewhere and eat it all up without any shape at all.

Policemen are scary. I don&#39;t like them, they like to chase me and shoot at me. But my head hurts, so I&#39;ll be a policeman now.

I took a chance once, and went up to a house without a shape. I don&#39;t know why I did it, maybe I&#39;d eaten too much candy and gotten silly on the sugar. It never goes right most days, people always scream and run when they see me without a shape, or they try to hurt me and I have to run. But on Halloween, I&#39;m a ghost, or Rorschach (who&#39;s Rorschach?), or a swamp monster, or a Shoggoth (don&#39;t know what that is either). They aren&#39;t scared, they tell me what a great costume I have and give me extra candy.

Should I be a vampire? Or a werewolf? Or a mummy? I see all of them, and I can&#39;t decide.

But I can&#39;t be myself very often, because I know Mr. Redd is after me. He&#39;s always been chasing me, but he can&#39;t ever find me. I know how much it makes him angry, though - every since that one night, he knows I spend all of Halloween out and vulnerable, but I wear so many different shapes he never knows what I am and I&#39;m always picking a new one. He get so angry, and it&#39;s funny.

Ooh, there&#39;s a spy. I see them a lot, even when it&#39;s not Halloween. They don&#39;t look like spies, they look like normal people, but no one&#39;s better than me at seeing someone whose outside is changed. I know they&#39;re all friends, because inside they all look similar, and I can see that too. I&#39;ll be a spy, and go talk to him. Maybe I can get him to think I&#39;m a spy like he is too. Maybe he&#39;ll give me candy.</textarea></pre>
