An instance of SCP-5694 attempting to escape notice.
[[/div]]
[[/div]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** The only surviving instance of SCP-5694 is in United States Army detention. Director Paul Lague (Site-322) is engaged in dialogue with the Secretary of the Army to secure its release to Foundation custody.

No means of preventing SCP-5694 manifestation has yet been discovered. Containment efforts must be focused on amnesticization of witnesses and control of witness accounts.

-----

**Description:** SCP-5694 instances are identical humanoid entities resembling a balding white male with a chinstrap beard, approximately thirty years of age. While their ability to speak English suggests sapience, dialogues with SCP-5694 instances inevitably decline into nonsensicality in short order. Every encounter reported thus far has occurred at a place of business in the United States, with similar thematic undertones. Until 16/08/2019, these encounters were described to local law enforcement rather than caught on film. Examples have included:

||~ Date of SCP-5694 Sighting ||~ Interaction ||
|| 01/01/2015 || Entity attempted to purchase a bow and arrow from a Cabela&#39;s Inc. store in Pennsylvania,  expressing a desire to &#34;gain violence for money.&#34; ||
|| 29/08/2017 || Entity attempted to hire a bodyguard from Wright Security Solutions in Colorado, promising to &#34;pay well for assault.&#34; ||
|| 16/03/2018 || Entity attempted to purchase munitions from the United States Air Force, for the stated purpose of &#34;having the explosions we all enjoy.&#34; ||
|| 18/06/2019 || Entity attempted to adopt a Pekingese toy dog from a shelter in Nashville, Tennessee, to acquire &#34;extra teeth, for harm.&#34; ||

When successfully able to complete its desired transactions, each SCP-5694 instance pays with a functioning VISA credit card and leaves the premises on foot.[[footnote]]VISA Inc. claims the credit card number in question has not yet been assigned, and is in fact invalid.[[/footnote]] It collapses in mid-step shortly thereafter, dropping its purchases and immediately expiring.

Autopsy of SCP-5694 instances reveals a physical structure superficially similar to that of a baseline human being, but composed primarily of elements from porcine biology. Trace elements not found naturally in the Earth&#39;s biosphere have been identified in each instance&#39;s bloodstream.

SCP-5694 instances make overt attempts to avoid being photographed or filmed; these are invariably unsuccessful.

------

On 16/08/2019, an instance of SCP-5694 entered Silvestri&#39;s Garden Supply in Olympia, Washington during a taped training exercise. It approached owner Mario Silvestri and trainee Tatiana Fonseca to open a dialogue. The resultant footage is transcribed below.

**«BEGIN LOG»**

**SCP-5694:** This is where I am, like they said.

**Fonseca:** Uh... 

//(Fonseca looks to Silvestri, who shrugs.)//

**Fonseca:** Need any help?

**SCP-5694:** I am here to do the buy!

//(Fonseca stares at SCP-5694 for a moment, then rallies.)//

**Fonseca:** Well, that&#39;s... great, because we&#39;re here to... do the sell!

**SCP-5694:** Can I buy the kill?

**Fonseca:** ...what?

**SCP-5694:** We or I would like to purchase death.

//(Fonseca laughs nervously.)//

**SCP-5694:** Ha ha ha ha.

**Fonseca:** What do you actually mean, though.

**SCP-5694:** Death spray! To melt the insides.

**Fonseca:** Are you from Canada, or something?

**Silvestri:** Hey, do you mean pesticides? You want to buy a pesticide?

**SCP-5694:** Pesticide.

**Silvestri:** To kill bugs?

//(Silvestri indicates a small scurrying creature with his fingers.)//

**SCP-5694:** Correct! I want to capitalize small murder.

**«END LOG»**

[[/div]]

The instance attempted to purchase the store&#39;s entire stock of pesticides. When informed that a commercial license is required to make such a large purchase, it settled on five cans of organophosphate spray. It then proceeded to conduct the same transaction at four other garden centers in the area.

An SCP-5694 instance was next recorded on 22/04/2020 at Bellissimo Bar and Grill in South Bend, Indiana. Security cameras captured the following interactions with hostess Wiola Balik:

**SCP-5694:** I arrive for the consumption queue.

**Balik:** That&#39;s the spirit.

**SCP-5694:** I wish to incorporate the smaller.

**Balik:** Uh. Well, follow me.

//(Balik gestures at the tables, and moves towards them. SCP-5694 does not follow.)//

**SCP-5694:** I am doing this correctly.

**Balik:** Yeah, well done.

**SCP-5694:** Say loudly that I&#39;m not doing this wrong.

**Balik:** Did you come here to eat, or...?

**SCP-5694:** Eat?

**Balik:** Yeah. Eat.

**SCP-5694:** Eat? Let me check &#34;eat.&#34;

//(SCP-5694 stares at Balik for approximately five seconds, eyes blank.)//

**Balik:** Uh--

**SCP-5694:** Yeah, eat. Consume. I wanna diminish you.

**Balik:** I don&#39;t... what?

**SCP-5694:** Ha ha ha ha.

**Balik:** Is this a bit? Or do you actually want to sit down?

**SCP-5694:** I will reduce via mastication, and pay for the privilege.

**Balik:** Buddy, this ain&#39;t that kind of bar.

= **Addendum 5694.3: Final Recorded Sighting**
------

The most recent civilian encounter with an instance of SCP-5694 was experienced by Boris Kovac, manager of human resources at Briscomb, Fowler and Cross LLC, who recorded the following abortive telephone interview on 15/07/2020:

**SCP-5694:** Is this the people mill?

**Kovac:** What?

**SCP-5694:** The people mill. To mill the people. The people mill.

**Kovac:** I don&#39;t know if you think you&#39;re being funny--

**SCP-5694:** Ha ha ha ha.

**Kovac:** --but I&#39;m not hiring court jesters today. Now, what are your long-term career goals?

**SCP-5694:** I will decrease others to enlarge myself.

**Kovac:** Okay, that isn&#39;t--

**SCP-5694:** We want to resource the humans.

**Kovac:** Kid, if you&#39;re not gonna take this seriously I&#39;ve got ten more applicants who will.

**SCP-5694:** Work harder, work harder. Do I pass?

= **Addendum 5694.4: Present Status**
------

A surviving SCP-5694 instance was taken into military custody after approaching an army recruitment office in Miami, Florida with the stated aim of &#34;joining the murder company, for funding.&#34; Its failure to expire has been attributed to a lack of official response to this enquiry.
