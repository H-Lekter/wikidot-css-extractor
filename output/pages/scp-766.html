**Item #:** SCP-766

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to SCP-766&#39;s immobile nature, Site-362 has been built around it. Operated by dummy corporation ██████ ███ ██ in ██████, Indonesia, SCP-766 is stored in a locked room behind the site&#39;s storage room. A wooden crate has been lowered over it, which is fastened to a cleat on the floor by a combination lock.

Though classified as Safe, precautions should be taken when interacting with SCP-766. Leather gloves and Plexiglas visors are recommended for handling, and are stored on-site.

**Description:** SCP-766 is a human-shaped anomaly in space that matter cannot pass through, making it, in effect, an invisible &#34;statue&#34; of a person. Plaster applied to the anomaly has allowed researchers to study its shape: It is in the shape of a perfectly anatomically correct nude woman in her late 30s with features consistent with the native population of the island. It is running, mid-stride, and looking behind, up, and to the left. The right hand forms a fist with the fingers leaving a hollow, cylindrical opening, suggesting that it once held an implement of some sort. A band on the left shoulder is indented in a way that the strap of a satchel might cause. SCP-766&#39;s facial expression appears both exhausted and startled.

SCP-766 was once known to the local population as the &#34;Woman-Bearing Tree.&#34; A //Santalum album// had grown around it, suggesting its shape. It had been considered a local botanical oddity until a forest fire in 19██, which destroyed the tree and left ash resting atop SCP-766, making it appear that the debris was floating. Foundation agents intervened, sequestering it.

SCP-766 does not appear to actually be constructed from any sort of material. X-rays do not show its form and tests to determine conductivity have returned no results. Sonar remains the sole effective imaging technique. Attempts to obtain a sample of SCP-766 using diamond-tipped drills resulted in broken machinery.

All elements of SCP-766 are solid and immobile. This extends to its &#34;hair&#34;, and agents should be mindful to avoid puncture wounds. The use of on-site safety equipment, though not mandatory, is strongly recommended. Attempts to relocate SCP-766 have proven ineffective. The use of bulldozers and other heavy machinery to move it has been attempted, to no avail.

**Addendum 766-01:**

//Time and resources providing, studies using the services of [[[SCP-182]]] or any other mediums at the Foundation&#39;s disposal could provide fruitful results. Though other tests have turned up nothing, perhaps an intellect can be sensed using the talents of some of our other SCPs.//
-Dr █████

-Request denied pending unforeseen allowances in extra resources.
