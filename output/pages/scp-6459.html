**Special Containment Procedures:**SCP-6459 cannot be contained, any attempts on containing SCP-6459 will results in said anomaly glaciating the area and have a high chance breaching the site. SCP-6459 was currently found roaming in the lightless area of heavy containment zone. 

**Description:** SCP-6459 is a multicolored, luminary entity, roughly represents a serpentine. SCP-6459 remain invisible under any form of light and only appears under a dark, freezing environment. SCP-6459 is approximately 90 feet in length. When on sight, SCP-6459 possess an ability to emit harmless SCP-6459-2. Subject was also able to emit and shift it&#39;s aspect color in blue,  purple and pink. In rare occasion, a white gleaming waves could be seen flowing in SCP-6459&#39;s dazzling aspect. A few specific features and extra patterns were occupied on SCP-6459. Subject is covered in translucent ice for unknown reason.

When interact with SCP-6459, test subject must remain distant while communicating. If SCP-6459 shown any form of agitation, Subject is to be sedated with silica, cryostat or ink. SCP-6459 is usually docile on communicating with personnel, using either soft incoherent metal prongs or telepathy to communicate with opponent. Most conversations last short and interviewers could only receive information with observation. Site personnel is still debating on cross testing other anomalies with SCP-6459.

 When SCP-6459 touch the solid surface, the anomaly will leave a trail of multicolored fluid, which is different when in contact with water surface, causing the water surface to immediately solidify into thin ice. Given that SCP-6459 had a shapeless body, SCP-6459 does not shape shift, only travel through solid objects or obstacles easily and leaving stain marks. Under a breach, emitted SCP-6459-2 would turn slightly hostile, but not enough to put lives at risk.

**Discovery:** SCP-6459 was first found wandering above the Pacific ocean near China on 20th December,2011[[footnote]] SCP-6459 was found a day before the Winter Solstice. [[/footnote]] by an Optic and Astrology Scientist, Dr. Smear. The anomaly was slithering on the frozen ocean surface, while emitting several SCP-6459-2. 
 
The anomaly is performing their anomalous abilities on the surface, fully aware of the visitors. The visitors were interrogated and they refers to the anomaly as an &#39;illusory attraction displayed by the government&#39; and they stated that&#39;s what make the Pacific ocean vivid and attractive.

Three group of MTF were assigned on retrieving SCP-6459 back to the facility. The anomaly did get slightly irritated after the MTF arrived, but later complied by flying towards the helicopter before the vehicle lands. Although the troops try to contain the anomaly, it instead, refuse to comply as it hisses, even threatened to harm the troops. The troops slowly give up as they successfully brought the anomaly back to the facility without any injuries.
 


**Addendum:** [[collapsible show=&#34;+ Open&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]

**Addendum-A:** SCP-6459-2&#39;s description
SCP-6459-2 is a small colorful sparkle-shaped entities that is emitted by SCP-6459. SCP-6459-2 does twinkle and able to explode when in contact. [[footnote]] When SCP-6459-2 explodes, it will also produce a small veil of aurora while the effects occur.[[/footnote]]  SCP-6459-2 would lead to two possibility, which is a ray of blinding light or causing glaciation. When a SCP-6459-2 solidify, researchers were able to extract and examine the anomaly. The secondary anomaly was later discovered containing acetic acid, silica, nitrogen, gunpowder etc. Although how the SCP-6459-2  floats or solidify was still consider anomalous.

**Addendum-B:** Table of researcher reports of SCP-6459&#39;s behavior
||~ NO. ||~ OCCASION ||~ PROCEDURE ||
|| 1. || 13rd May ||A group of 6 novice MTF guards encountered SCP-6459 after their duty in the cafeteria. The door was jammed when the group witnessed the anomaly. The group fired numerous bullets toward SCP-6459 and one tried to chained it, but SCP-6459 did not take any damages as the anomaly was protected by the ice surrounding it. The anomaly did not attack the guard, instead it beamed a blinding light and flee from the scene.||SCP-6459&#39;s ability is recorded as blinding lights and considered sentient. 
|| 2. || 20th May ||SCP-6459 was given a small chunk of crystals. The anomaly examined the quartz, and started to consume the provided crystals. A few moments later, SCP-6459 started to emit brighter lights, SCP-6459-2 solidify during the current event. SCP-6459 becomes more compliant and tamed at a short amount of time.[[footnote]] Crystal anomalies could tame SCP-6459 fully and increase the amount of time the tame lasted, but would neutralized the given crystal anomaly and some researchers refuse to risk it. [[/footnote]]||
|| 3. || 7th June || A scientist insist on giving SCP-6459 a test on a container filled with unknown black substance. The scientist approached SCP-6459 and placed the black substance near SCP-6459, hoping to get some reaction from the fluid provided. SCP-6459, surprisingly, did not pass out or resist on the black substance&#39;s odor, instead they show visible interests towards the mysterious liquid.|| 
|| 4. || 9th June || Three disposable class personnel were escorted into SCP-6459&#39;s boundary as test subjects. SCP-6459 started by approaching the test subjects, the anomaly let out metal prongs. The test subjects tried to defend themselves from any attack the anomaly will attack, but SCP-6459 comfort and //reassure them by talking// rather than assaulting the test subjects. The three test subjects was later escorted back to their cells.||
