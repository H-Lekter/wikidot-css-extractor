**Item #:** SCP-5802

**Clearance Level:** 4 (Secret)

**Containment Class:** --Uncontained-- Euclid

**Disruption Class:** Ekhi

**Risk Class:** Critical
-----
**Special Containment Procedures:**
A 5-kilometre exclusion zone has been established around SCP-5802 and SCP-5802-1, ringed by a circular perimeter. Aside from PTF Rho-17 (&#34;The Cleanup Crew&#34;), no personnel are to enter this exclusion zone for any reason. Personnel found breaking this rule are subject to termination. 

All approaching persons are to be detained and amnesticized with necessary force to prevent entry into SCP-5802’s exclusion zone. Approaching SCP-3396-01 instances are to be terminated with extreme prejudice by PTF Rho-18 (&#34;Factory Patrol&#34;). Should PTF Rho-18 be unsuccessful, a localised state of emergency is to be declared. This state of emergency dictates that any available Task Forces are to travel to SCP-5802’s exclusion zone to assist in the termination of the SCP-3396-01 instances. Arriving Task Forces are subject to the same quarantine protocols as PTF Rho-17 and -18.

The members of PTF Rho-17 (&#34;The Cleanup Crew&#34;) are to patrol SCP-5802’s surrounds and neutralise any found SCP-5802-2 instances. Before and after entry into SCP-5802 exclusion zone, Rho-17 members are to undergo Class IX[[footnote]]Extreme biological/chemical/thaumaturgical hazard with a capacity to spread.[[/footnote]] quarantine protocols and outfitted with Class-5802 Hazardous Material Suits. Contaminated members are to be terminated and the remains incinerated.

SCP-5802 is currently under investigation for its continued and consistent acquisition of large amounts of monetary assets in the form of stocks and physical stockpiles of various fossil fuels (petroleum, coal, natural gas, etc.), chemicals, both artificial and natural, used in the construction of man-made materials, radioactive and corrosive substances, and various toxic and/or otherwise pollutant anomalous items.

Investigations into SCP-5802-1 are currently ongoing. 
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ View Archived Containment Procedures - 27/9/17 +&#34; hide=&#34;- Close -&#34;]]
SCP-5802 is to be shut down by any means necessary, as it is currently uncontained and poses a severe threat to the integrity of the Veil. Containment efforts should primarily focus on: 
* The suppression of information regarding SCP-5802 to the public
* Attempts to prevent or otherwise inhibit the growth of SCP-5802&#39;s monetary assets
* The capture and containment of SCP-5802-1A and -1B
* The capture and interrogation of SCP-5802-2 instances for information regarding SCP-5802, -1A and -1B, and -3 instances
* The minimisation of fallout from SCP-5802-3 instances
* The movement of civilians out of areas that could potentially be affected by SCP-5802-3 instances presently or in the near future (based on analysis of movement)

SCP-5802 can be considered Neutralised if one of the three following conditions are met: complete liquidation or otherwise destruction of SCP-5802 assets, the complete destruction of all SCP-5802-2 and 3 instances and the prevention of further instances from manifesting, or the successful assassination of SCP-5802-1A and -1B.

Currently, efforts are underway to neutralise SCP-5802 in collaboration with Skitter Marshall and his subordinates, defectors from Marshall, Carter, and Dark, and various other GoIs (including, but not limited to, The Serpent&#39;s Hand, Global Occult Coalition (GOC), and Manna Charitable Foundation).

The use of MTF Omega 8 (&#34;Empyrean Warriors&#34;), as well as other anomalous personnel and weaponry, has been authorised in containment/neutralisation efforts of SCP-5802.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ View Archived Containment Procedures - 15/10/17 +&#34; hide=&#34;- Close -&#34;]]
Containment or neutralisation of SCP-5802 is currently of highest Foundation priority. If left unchecked, SCP-5802 will inevitably result in an IK-Class &#34;Collapse of Global Civilisation Scenario&#34;, followed by an XK-Class &#34;End-of-the-World&#34; Scenario. 

SCP-5802-1A and 1B are to be terminated by any means necessary, and consequences up to and including a Lifted Veil Scenario are acceptable.

SCP-5802-2 instances are to be captured and interrogated for information regarding SCP-5802, -1A and -1B, and -3 instances. Upon conclusion of interrogation, they are to be terminated and their bodies incinerated. 

SCP-5802-3 instances are to be destroyed if possible. If not, civilians are to be moved out of the potential fallout zones.

Methods of safely penetrating or neutralising SCP-5802-4, minimising its effects on the surrounding environment, luring SCP-5802-1A and -1B out of its area, or otherwise circumventing its anomalous effects for the purposes of -1A and -1B&#39;s termination are currently of highest priority.

**Description:**
SCP-5802 refers to a circular area with a diameter of 4km containing a collection of inactive factories[[footnote]]Numbering over 10000 in total.[[/footnote]] (collectively referred to as SCP-5802-A) in a state of disrepair, once owned by Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd. They are scattered throughout SCP-5802 and are centred around SCP-5802-1, the density of the buildings increasing the closer to SCP-5802-1 they are. Additionally, the area displays higher than usual readings of Akiva radiation that, like the SCP-5802-A instances, increases the closer to SCP-5802-1 it is.

SCP-5802 is heavily polluted by various substances, ranging from non-anomalous smog, oil, and toxic waste, to extremely volatile thaumaturgical substances that significantly affect the local area. Notably, this waste does not spread past the bounds of SCP-5802, but is instead prevented from passing by an intangible barrier surrounding the exact circumference. This barrier only affects the aforementioned waste; all other organisms (including SCP-5802-2 instances) and items simply pass through it.

Organisms that come into direct contact with any of the pollutant substances of SCP-5802 will inevitably die of overexposure to the contacted toxic element, even if the quantity and form of exposure is insufficient to cause death. Upon the cessation of life functions, organisms will undergo a series of anomalous changes to physiological structure, biochemistry, and thought processes, becoming an SCP-5802-2 instance.

SCP-5802-A instances vary in structure, appearance, size, and composition. Several are little more than small concrete warehouses, whilst others are enormous mining complexes with several floors extending hundreds of metres underground. Although instances of SCP-5802-A are functionally inactive, most artificial lighting and other superficial operations are still running.

Within individual instances of SCP-5802-A, large amounts of inert anomalous machinery and piles of various pollutants can found. This machinery appears to have been used for purposes that vary within each instance, but can be split into four categories:
* The processing, refining, and packaging of fossil fuels
* The processing, refining, and packaging of various chemicals
* The processing, refining, and packaging of nuclear materials and other substances with adverse side effects on human health
* The processing, refining, and packaging of thaumaturgical materials and other anomalous substances

Anomalous additions to the machinery within SCP-5802-A instances vary wildly, but will consistently increase the machinery&#39;s efficiency (lowered power and resource consumption, etc.), increase the quality of produced products, increase the structural integrity of both the machinery and the factory it is housed in, add various extradimensional gateways for faster transportation through the factory or even as connections to other SCP-5802-A instances, and produce the highest possible quantity of waste products (even if this means extracting the necessary components from the type of product being processed) with the most damaging effects on the surrounding environment.

Numerous SCP-5802-A instances have entire sections devoted to the synthesis of waste products, or, in the case of Factories 19B, 120C, and 342F, are entirely devoted to the creation of waste products, using the previously mentioned extradimensional gateways to transport the required materials.

SCP-5802-1 is a circular area with a diameter of 200m, set at the centre of the collection of SCP-5802-A instances. At SCP-5802-1&#39;s centre is a single 5802-A instance, referred to as SCP-5802-A1. SCP-5802-1 is extremely densely polluted, even when compared to the rest of SCP-5802[[footnote]]For example, the AQI of SCP-5802 is, on average, 402, while SCP-5802-1&#39;s AQI is far beyond 500, the most severe measure.[[/footnote]], and otherwise differs significantly from SCP-5802 due to a high amount of anomalous waste.

SCP-5802-1 has an inconsistent topography, and appears to be partially intersected with higher spatial dimensions. It is subject to variable anomalous phenomena associated with an unstable reality, such as spatial &#39;bleeding&#39; and fracturing, extreme unnatural weather (such as rains of ignited oil, tornadoes of various natural gases and nuclear elements, areas of spontaneous total darkness that cause reality within to temporarily cease existing, etc.), and temporal fluctuation.

SCP-5802-A1 is, unlike other 5802-A instances, empty, save for several corpses belonging to various GoIs, members of MTF Omega-8, and Iris Dark and Robert Carter. Due to the poorly understood efforts of Omega-8 member Kieran Trelock, the corpses of these GoIs and the rest of his MTF have not transformed into instances of SCP-5802-2. 

The corpse of Iris Dark is a large, fossilised skeleton that is encased in a translucent combination of oils, toxic waste, and anomalous thaumaturgical waste products. Their skeleton differs from baseline humans through the addition of four heads extending from the Axis (C2) Cervical vertebrae that resemble those of a non-anomalous //Tyrannosaurus Rex// (large teeth, ellipsoid shape, etc.), a long, piked tail, and an unfolded ribcage.

The corpse of Robert Carter is a large pit of rusted machinery over 20m deep, with their enormous, mechanized face (resembling that of someone in the last stages of SCP-217 infection) at the bottom. Attached to this machinery is a diverse, inactive assortment of tools found in SCP-5802-A instances (such as vacuum tubes, buzzsaws, hammers, laser splitters, and tranaculars[[footnote]]A long, tapered tube which creates brief, localised fields of massively increased Humes for the harvesting of unstable anomalous material.[[/footnote]]), weaponry (guns, rocket launchers, particle cannons, and plasma accelerators), and tubes connected to various SCP-5802-3 instances for the discharge of harmful materials and waste products.

SCP-5802-2 instances are the highly mutated, reanimated corpses of organisms directly exposed to SCP-5802 pollutants. Mutations are disparate between instances with no discernible pattern, except for predacious qualities, an increase in intelligence, and a desire to expose as many organisms as possible to the interior of SCP-5802 for the creation of more 5802-2 instances.

SCP-5802 is C&amp;D Holdings Ltd, a splinter company of Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd. C&amp;D Holdings is a company which processes and sells various fossil fuels, chemicals, nuclear material, and anomalous substances. 

Their legal business is currently under investigation for a presumed predictive anomaly (SCP-5802-1), which has so far allowed the enormous and continuous acquisition of high-value stocks in several (previously) relatively obscure oil and chemical companies, which have since merged with SCP-5802. In 100% of cases as of yet, companies that SCP-5802 invests in will find a considerable amount of their respective material (oil, gas, nuclear elements, etc.) within 15 days of being invested in. 

Despite being a relatively new company, SCP-5802 is already twentieth-highest valued out of all companies in their field. If allowed to grow further, SCP-5802 could gain a total monopoly over all companies of their branch, giving Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd extreme financial power.

SCP-5802-1 is the presumed predictive anomaly that SCP-5802 is using for stock purposes. Its appearance, method of function, and origin are unknown, yet it has already displayed the strength of its abilities through SCP-5802. Containment of SCP-5802-1 is currently of moderate priority.

SCP-5802 is C&amp;D Holdings Ltd. Previously a splinter of Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd, SCP-5802 has since replaced it entirely while keeping remaining operations intact, though with a greater focus on SCP-5802 industry branch. SCP-5802 is currently the fifth-highest valued company of its field, and is set to overtake the highest-valued company, China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation, in the coming weeks.

SCP-5802-1A and -1B are Robert Carter and Iris Dark, respectively. Through various interviews with PoI-5802-1 (Skitter Marshall), it was ascertained that SCP-5802-1A and -1B were exposed to solution from SCP-3396, becoming 3396-01 instances. The strength of their abilities seems to be directly affected by the value of SCP-5802 stocks, as well as its position in the global market. The higher the value and position of SCP-5802, the stronger SCP-5802-1A and -1B&#39;s abilities become. 

SCP-5802-1A has the ability to manifest complex machinery for various purposes at will. This machinery has several anomalous properties, such as increased efficiency, increased quality of products, and greatly increased structural integrity. Although the strength of his abilities was previously ~50-60 on the Empyrean Power Scale[[footnote]]An exponential scale measuring the strength of SCP-3396-01 instances through a variety of factors (such as Hume displacement, measured &#39;output&#39;, etc.).[[/footnote]] (50-60 denotes a moderately strong ability, and in this case 5802-1A was able to manifest up to 5 tonnes of machinery at a time before losing consciousness), it has since steadily increased to ~150-170 EPS, allowing the manifestation of up to 100 tonnes of machinery before losing consciousness, along with stronger anomalous modifications and more complex designs. His whereabouts are currently unknown.

SCP-5802-1B has the ability to manifest various substances associated with environmental damage, such as fossil fuels, chemicals both natural and artificial, nuclear materials, highly toxic/corrosive materials, and various anomalous materials. The strength of her abilities was previously ~70-80 EPS, allowing the manifestation of up to 10 tonnes of raw material before losing consciousness. Currently, her abilities rank ~200 EPS, allowing the manifestation of up to 400 tonnes of material before losing consciousness. Additionally, her appearance and bodily composition have undergone numerous unspecified changes, but have allowed her to survive all assassination attempts and kill her assailants. Her location is currently within the metropolitan area of Toronto.

SCP-5802-2 collectively refers to the employees of SCP-5802, who have undergone numerous changes to their physiology and mental state. Changes include increased endurance and energy, the addition of various extendable mechanical tools from their spines, and a near-fanatical devotion to SCP-5802 success. The method of adding these changes on such a wide scale (as 5802-2 instances currently number approximately 20000) is unknown.

SCP-5802-3 refers to numerous factories under SCP-5802 which have began to manifest in various areas. These factories are responsible for the processing, refining, and packaging of the various materials that SCP-5802-1B produces, and are staffed by SCP-5802-2 instances. They produce large amounts of pollution and waste products, which have detrimental effects on the surrounding area, civilian health, and the environment at large, and resist all civilian assaults.

SCP-5802-3 instances are currently manifesting in the countryside of Ontario, CA. Predictive pattern analysis suggests that they are travelling directly towards Manitoba, but will detour to within all major cities within 5 square kilometres of this path. Civilan evacuation efforts are underway.

SCP-5802 is C&amp;D Holdings Ltd, a splinter company of Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd which has since overtaken its parent company. Currently, C&amp;D Holdings operates in the fields of production and processing of fossil fuels, various chemicals, nuclear materials, highly toxic/corrosive substances, and anomalous/thaumaturgical substances. It is the highest-valued company in all of these fields, and has since assimilated most lower-valued companies in these fields into itself.

SCP-5802-1A and -1B (Robert Carter and Iris Dark, respectively) are SCP-3396-01 instances that have gained the anomalous abilities to manifest large amounts of anomalous machinery (-1A) and the materials of SCP-5802&#39;s fields (-1B). Their abilities, as of writing this document, rank at ~300 EPS, making them the fourth most-powerful 3396-01 instances ever recorded. 

SCP-5802-1A can generate up to 1000 tonnes of machinery with extremely strong anomalous properties before fatiguing, while -1B can generate up to 2000 tonnes of raw material before fatiguing. Additionally, both SCP-5802-1A and -1B have undergone significant changes to their physiology. 

SCP-5802-1A resembles a large, 20m deep pit of complex machinery, tools, weaponry, and tubes for the discharge of waste products from SCP-5802-3 instances. A gargantuan form of his face (approximating someone in the last stages of SCP-217 infection) lies at the bottom of the pit.

SCP-5802-1B resembles an animate fossilised skeleton with splayed ribs and several reptilian skulls emerging from her spine. Her muscles and skin have been replaced by large quantities of the materials she produces (oils, nuclear material, etc.) which form into simulacrums of her previous appearance.

SCP-5802-2 collectively refers to the employees of SCP-5802; as of time of writing, they number over 100 000. Along with increased durability, energy, and strength, they possess a near-fanatical devotion to SCP-5802. Additionally, their physiology has been changed into various barely humanoid forms, incorporating seemingly random physical elements from both SCP-5802-1A and -1B. 

SCP-5802-3 instances are currently concentrated around SCP-5802-4. They possess anomalously high structural integrity, and are devoted to the processing, refining, and packaging of the materials SCP-5802-1B produces. Significant portions of SCP-5802-3 instances are devoted to the synthesis of harmful waste products, which are subsequently released into the surrounding environment.

SCP-5802-4 was formerly Lake Winnipeg. Due to the use of much of its water in SCP-5802-3 instances as a manufacturing resource, and the addition of massive amounts of anomalous pollution, it has shrunk to a circular area with a diameter of 200m. A single SCP-5802-3 instance has manifested in the exact centre. It is immeasurably highly polluted with various materials, and the addition of anomalous refuse has cause the area to gain non-Euclidean properties and convert exposed organisms to SCP-5802-2 instances. SCP-5802-1A and -1B currently reside within the lone SCP-5802-3 instance.

**Associated Documents:**
The following documents form a timeline of the events from SCP-5802-1A and -1B&#39;s conversion to SCP-3396-01 instances to their deaths. Most of these were recovered after the deaths of SCP-5802-1A and -1B. Analysis is underway in order to prevent future similar events from occurring.

//Skitter Marshall bursts through the door to the ward, panting. Iris Dark turns to face him. In the next bed over, Robert Carter lies unconscious.//

**Dark:** Look at who&#39;s arrived.... (//she pauses for several seconds to examine her digital watch//) 2 minutes and 27 seconds late. So much for being punctual.

**Marshall:** (//Breathing heavily//) It&#39;s not (//inhales//) like you just (//inhales//) ran up (//inhales//) 7 flights (//inhales//) of stairs. 

**Dark:** Stairs? There&#39;s an elevator for a reason, you know. 

**Marshall:** (//Still breathing heavily//) It&#39;s out of order.

**Dark:** How unfortunate. Well, I&#39;ll give you some time to catch your breath. In the meantime, you want me to explain how we got here?

(//Marshall nods and leans against the left wall.//)

**Dark:** Well, after we almost died in Santiago, things were looking grim. All of our agents, barring Jacobi, were dead, Carter was seriously wounded, I couldn&#39;t really move, our transport was destroyed, and our money was gone. Even worse, our &#39;clients&#39; (//Dark places emphasis on this word with air quotes//) were still chasing us. We were, as you would put it, fucked. Even though we managed to escape our pursuers by hiding in a wheat field, we were still stranded in the middle of nowhere. That is, until Jacobi noticed that the wheat was watching us.

**Marshall:** Wait. &#39;The wheat was watching you&#39;? 

**Dark:** Not literally of course. There was a kid there, hiding in the wheat field, just watching us. Damn near gave Jacobi a heart attack.

**Marshell:** (//Sighs//) Why&#39;d you have to phrase it like that? I thought you&#39;d gotten brain-damaged for a moment there.

**Dark:** Shh. I&#39;m telling our story here. Now shut up.

(//Marshall seems like he is about to speak, but is silenced by a glare from Dark.//)

**Dark:** Getting back to the topic at hand, Jacobi noticed the kid. He called out in Spanish that we&#39;re injured and needed some help, and the kid stuck their hand out of the wheat and beckoned us forward. So Carter and Jacobi carried me forward, and Jacobi supported Carter. We moved through the wheat field, following the kid, when all of a sudden there were villagers all around us. I&#39;m put on this primitive stretcher, Carter gets several people to support him, and Jacobi&#39;s accosted on all sides by old women speaking //far// too quickly. We&#39;re ushered to this little village in the countryside, surrounded on all sides by that wheat field, and Carter and I start getting treated. Medicine, splints, stitches, the works. The people that were treating me apologised and said that their &#39;Healer&#39; wouldn&#39;t be back for a while, so we&#39;d have to make do with this for this for now. I was quite confused, until I saw the same kid from the wheat field earlier. He was facing the field, and as he stepped forward the wheat just //bent// out of his way, and then, as he passed through, they shut behind him. As I sat there blinking stupidly, I saw another kid practicing soccer by herself with a ball made of fire. Everywhere I looked, people were using... magic.

**Marshall:** &#39;Magic&#39;? 

**Dark:** Best way I can describe it. Unless you&#39;d find &#39;anomalous abilities&#39; — like those stiffs at the Foundation — preferable. 

**Marshall:** God damn it.

**Dark:** Thought so. Now, can I continue?

**Marshall:** Fine, fine. I hate that we&#39;re calling it magic now, though.

(//Dark smirks.//)

**Dark:** Well, if you come up with a better name, be sure to tell me.

(//Marshall grumbles incoherently.//)

**Dark:** Getting back to the topic at hand //again//, people were using magic everywhere I looked. It was... an incredible experience, to say the least. I got another kid to come over, asked him why everyone had magic. He told me that they&#39;d found a tree growing in their village, with a glowing liquid at its base. People touched it, poked at it, even drank it out of curiosity, and now everyone had magic. I asked about his ability, and he conjured a swarm of butterflies with glowing, rainbow-coloured wings. I didn&#39;t even have time to fully appreciate them before I heard the gunshot, and they scattered and disappeared. 

(//Dark places her head in her hands.//)

**Dark:** They- they fucking shot him, Marshall. Right through the heart. I watched him as he tried to speak, call out, //anything// while his shirt just got redder and redder. Like some twisted, bloodied flower blooming across his chest. His killer, our client, just stood there, still holding a smoking handgun, fucking //grinning// at me. (//Deep breath.//) I couldn&#39;t take that, and I felt something inside me snap, trite as it is. I held up my hand to his chest, and I watched as his grin slid off his face while he clutched at his throat. Last I saw, there was a trickle of something black leaking from his blue lips. (//Dark sighs.//) And then I passed out.

**Dark:** When I came to, Carter and I were in a horse-driven carriage. Jacobi wasn&#39;t with us. From there, we slowly made our way up to Delaware, the only place we could be treated. I don&#39;t know what exactly happened, or how we escaped, but from what the villager driving the carriage said, Jacobi gave those fuckers hell. 

(//Dark pauses for several seconds.//)

**Dark:** And that&#39;s our story, Marshall. We came here, got treated, I contacted you, you came, and here we are.

**Marshall:** Are you... okay?

**Dark:** Marshall, you of all people should know about how many people I&#39;ve killed; I&#39;m no stranger to death. I&#39;m just... more used to seeing people die who deserve it, not innocents. Not children.

**Marshall:** I don&#39;t know what to say.

**Dark:** Say nothing, then. 

(//There is silence for 23 seconds, before Marshall walks over to Dark and awkwardly hugs her, patting her on the back while doing so. He then steps back. Dark laughs.//)

**Dark:** God, you&#39;re terrible at this.

**Marshall:** I&#39;m trying my best, okay. People have never been my strong point.

**Dark:** No, exploiting legal loopholes for profit is more your style.

(//Marshall and Dark both smirk.//)

**Marshall:** I will admit, that whole thing with Article 17A of [REDACTED] was one of my finest moments.

**Dark:** I still can&#39;t decide if you were a genius or an imbecile for having the gall to use that in a legal battle. I thought the judge would explode, they were that red.

(//They both smile, before Marshall looks at Dark expectantly.//) 

**Marshall:** But getting back to the topic at hand, //again// again, what&#39;s your, uh, &#39;magic&#39;? 

**Dark:** I was wondering when you&#39;d ask.

(//Dark faces her palm towards the ceiling and squints. A large globule of oil forms, falling and splattering on the ground.//)

**Marshall:** So, it&#39;s oil creation?

**Dark:** Not just oil. I can produce all fossil fuels, several chemicals, nuclear material, and thaumaturgical material. Anything in those realms, and I can make it. (//Dark pauses briefly, looking confused.//) Huh. How did I know that?

**Marshall:** Hmm. How much can you make at a time? Does it hurt to produce it?

**Dark:** Well, I can produce up to a tonne of any of these total before I pass out for 8 hours, and it only requires my concentration. Again, no idea how I know this, but it&#39;s probably true. 

**Marshall:** Interesting. I think I see a use for this.

//Marshall and Dark discuss the possible usages of her powers for the next 20 minutes. After some deliberation, Marshall suggests the use of her abilities to manipulate the stock market.//

**Dark:** Manipulating the stock market... how?

**Marshall:** Well, if we invest in a small company and... //nudge// them towards a deposit of oil or gas that you&#39;ve built up...

(//Dark raises her eyebrows.//)

**Dark:** That&#39;s an interesting proposition. It could work.

**Marshall:** Could? You dare deny the sheer //genius// of my-

//Marshall is interrupted by Carter&#39;s stirring.//

**Dark and Marshall:** //Carter//?

(//Carter slowly regains consciousness, and is immediately asked of his condition, how he is feeling, and his mental state by both Marshall and Dark. After repeatedly assuring them both he is alright, Marshall asks of Carter&#39;s abilities.//)

**Carter:** Well, I can create machinery for basically all purposes, and it&#39;s more efficient, more stable, yada yada. Maximum weight at a time is 500 kilos before I pass out.

(//Carter pauses briefly.//)

**Carter:** How the fuck do I know that?

**Dark:** Don&#39;t question it. Same thing happened to me. 

**Carter:** Wait. You as well? 

**Dark:** Mmhm. I can create fossil fuels and radioactive stuff like plutonium. 1 tonne limit.

**Carter:** Interesting.

(//Marshall claps his hands and rubs them together.//)

**Marshall:** This seems to be a perfect combination. Dark, you know the plan I talked about?

**Dark:** Yep. Carter, you&#39;re perfect for the job.

**Carter:** Hold on? What&#39;s this?

**Marshall:** We&#39;re taking over the whole fossil fuels industry, and everything else associated with it. Care to join us?

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Proposal for Operation &#39;Black Gold&#39; +&#34; hide=&#34;- Close -&#34;]]
||||||||~ Operation &#34;Black Gold&#34; Proposal||
||~ Author || Skitter Marshall ||~ Date || May 10, 2017||
||~ To||Robert Carter, Iris Dark||~ Identifier|| N/A ||
|||||||| With your newfound abilities, there is ample opportunity for some rather clever manipulation of the stock market (if I do say so myself), spearheaded by a splinter organisation I&#39;ll call Carter and Dark Holdings. Even if this somehow fucks up, it won&#39;t affect us in the slightest.  _
 _
The plan is as follows: Dark, you&#39;re to manifest all the relevant resources you can into one area. After this process is finished, as many stocks as possible of any small nearby company which works with the gathered resource is to be bought by C&amp;D Holdings. Other companies are to be prevented access to this area, while the company we have stocks in is to be manoeuvred to the appropriate location. They find their resource in massive amounts, their stocks shoot up, C&amp;D sells these and makes absurd amounts of money. _
 _
Once the value of C&amp;D Holdings has reached at least the top fifty companies in its field, the assimilation process can begin. Carter, your job is to create the necessary machinery to refine, package, and distribute the materials C&amp;D Holdings has gathered to buyers. From here, the process is rinse and repeat. _
 _
One important thing to note is that we have to provide incentive for customers to buy our product in large amounts. To do this, C&amp;D Holdings is to prepare stocks for companies that are parts of opposing countries. Using a combination of political influence, assassinations, and outright lies, these countries will have tensions between them raised significantly, ensuring the buying of our resources in case of war. I have several disinformation campaigns prepared, as well as numerous antimemetic agents to obfuscate the true amounts of resources the opposing countries have from each other, causing confusion and panic. Again, this basically guarantees that the customers will buy up our stock. _
 _
There are numerous other finer details here that I have sent through encrypted files to necessary personnel, but I&#39;m sure you two get the gist of it. _
 _
 - To our success, _

Following this, C&amp;D Holdings increased in value to where it stood as of 19/7/17, attracting Foundation attention. Additionally, Carter and Dark&#39;s abilities had increased in power due to constant use to ~50-60 and ~70-80 ESP respectively. Recovered documents suggest that the first dissent between Marshall and Carter &amp; Dark appeared around this date.

(//Carter and Dark open the doors to the office and enter, looking confused. Marshall sits at the head of a large, circular, oak wood table, rubbing his temples with his hands.//)

**Marshall:** Come in. We need to talk.

(//Carter and Dark both take seats.//)

**Carter:** There any reason you called us in?

**Dark:** Well, it definitely wasn&#39;t to have a nice, rosy chat about how well we&#39;re doing.

(//Marshall shoots Dark a glance.//)

**Marshall:** 10 points to Dark. What the //fuck// have you two been doing?

**Carter:** I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t follow. Profits are high, everything&#39;s working we-

**Marshall:** That&#39;s not what I mean. I don&#39;t give a shit about the profits this time-

**Dark:** That&#39;s a first.

(//Marshall glares at her.//)

**Marshall:** Actually, I&#39;d like to ask you a question, //Iris//.

**Dark:** Go on.

**Marshall:** Out of all the places you could put oil, why the fuck was it in the middle of a rainforest?

(//Dark sighs.//)

**Dark:** Look, there wasn&#39;t enough space anywhere el-

(//Marshall slams the table with his hand.//)

**Marshall:** //Don&#39;t//. Feed. Me. Bullshit. There was plenty of fucking space in the goddamn empty, barren countryside around it, but you put it there. Why the fuck did you try to hide that from me? Hmm?

**Dark:** (//silence//)

**Marshall:** And you, Robert. When I said to hire people to work the machines, I didn&#39;t say to start a //fucking sweatshop// by tricking poor people in third-world countries. 

(//Carter smirks very briefly, but quickly covers it with his hand. Marshall doesn&#39;t seem to notice.//)

**Carter:** Look, I ca-

**Marshall:** No, I don&#39;t want to hear your bullshit. What the fuck has gotten into you two, huh? We&#39;re businesspeople, not goddamn tyrants! We don&#39;t fuck with the environment or roster people into slavery when we have other options, just for kicks. We do it when there&#39;s no other option. And yet, you two decide to do just that when we do. Explain.

(//Dark and Carter are both silent.//)

**Marshall:** Well?

(//Dark sighs.//)

**Dark:** We&#39;re making money, Marshall. //That&#39;s all that matters//. When the fuck has anything other than that concerned you?

**Carter:** I agree with her. When&#39;d you suddenly go all soft on us, Marshall?

**Marshall:** Do not try to turn this around onto me. You two are acting out of control, and you need to fucking get a grip. If I find out that you&#39;re pulling this shit again I am cancelling this operation, profits be damned. Now get out of my sight.

(//Dark and Carter rise stiffly, then leave. Marshall sighs, before turning around to the large window behind him and staring into the city. He continues this for 5 minutes, then turns to leave.//)

(//As he passes Iris Dark&#39;s seat, he notices something.//)

**Marshall:** Hmm?

(//He touches Dark&#39;s seat, and his fingers come off covered in oil. He squints, looking worried. Quickly, he runs to Carter&#39;s seat, gathering several items in his hand. Several rusted gears, cogs, and screws are visible.//)

**Marshall:** What the //fuck//?

On the 20th of September, 2017, the Foundation received a distress call from Skitter Marshall from within a warehouse in the city of Ontario.

**DATE:** 20/9/17

**NOTE:** Unless explicitly stated otherwise, Marshall is whispering throughout the phone call.
----

[BEGIN LOG]
**Agent Carlson:** Hello?

**Marshall:** Oh thank //fuck//. I&#39;ve never been so happy for a phone call in my life.

**Agent Carlson:** Who am I speaking to?

**Marshall:** Skitter Marshall, of MC&amp;D. I&#39;m giving you my coordinates now.

(//Agent Carlson receives a message detailing Marshall&#39;s location.//)

**Agent Carlson:** Okay, why the fuck are you calling us?

**Marshall:** It&#39;s Carter and Dark. They&#39;ve...

(//A muffled sob can be heard.//)

**Marshall:** I don&#39;t know what happened. They&#39;re not themselves anymore. 

**Agent Carlson:** What?

**Marshall:** Their abilities. They got exposed to, uh, what do you call it? SCP-3396. That. They got abilities, we monopolised on it. But they&#39;re out of control. I don&#39;t fucking know what happened, but they- they&#39;ve been corrupted somehow.

**Agent Carlson:** How do you know that item designation? That&#39;s top secret!

**Marshall:** It doesn&#39;t //matter//. What matters is the fact that they&#39;re fucking hunting me right now, and I can&#39;t-

(//Marshall is interrupted by the sound of a door opening.//)

**Marshall:** //Shit//. You gotta get me out, now. //They&#39;re here//.

**Carter, in the distance:** Marshall, come out now! Don&#39;t live up to your first name like this!

**Dark, in the distance:** Come on Marshall. We can open your eyes, just like ours were.

**Agent Carlson:** I see. We got an MTF squad coming, ETA five minutes. We&#39;re getting you out of there.

**Marshall:** Thank //fuck//. 

**Carter, in the distance:** Have I ever told you about the joy of industry? Seeing people work, their sweat glistening on their skin, their panting and heaving, is music to my ears! It&#39;s a beauty I&#39;ll help you appreciate, Marshall!

**Dark, in the distance:** And what better to go with industry than its products! The warm glow of uranium, the //hiss// of an acid eating away at a tree, dappled sunlight passing through clouds of smog... It&#39;s a sight to behold. 

**Carter and Dark, together in the distance:** We just want to show you beauty, Marshall!

**Marshall:** Hear that? That&#39;s them. They&#39;ve gone fucking insane.

**Carter, from closer:** Come on Marshall. You may be scared now, but you&#39;ll thank us when it&#39;s done.

**Marshall:** Fuck. ETA?

**Agent Carlson:** Two minutes.

**Marshall:** //Shit//.

**Dark, from closer:** We&#39;ll be together again, the big three of the business world! Join us, Marshall! We&#39;ll make the world our factory!

**Marshall:** Oh god, I can see her.

**Agent Carlson:** What? Get down!

**Marshall:** She&#39;s so... why is there so much oil? And are those... bones?

**Agent Carlson:** Get down! Do you want to be seen?

**Marshall:** Shit shit //shit.// I think she saw me. When&#39;s the fucking ETA?

**Agent Carlson:** 30 seconds.

**Marshall:** Fuck me.

(//The sounds of shuffling are heard. Suddenly, Dark&#39;s voice is heard from very close by. Notably, a faint gurgling undertone can be heard when she speaks.//)

**Dark:** Oh Marshall, where are you? Why do you have to make this so //difficult//?

**Marshall:** (//Heavy breathing.//)

**Agent Carlson, whispering:** 10 seconds.

**Carter, from above:** //There you are//.

**Marshall, shouting:** Oh //fuck//!

(//The phone registers several seconds of Marshall shouting indiscriminately before cutting out.//)

From the distress call onwards, several hundred defectors from MC&amp;D Ltd assisted in the SCP-5802 investigation and containment efforts. As investigations continued, the severity of SCP-5802 prompted the assistance of several GoIs into containing and/or destroying SCP-5802. Together with the members of MTF Omega-8 and several other highly skilled MTF personnel, a new MTF was formed for the assassination of SCP-5802-1A and -1B - MTF Tau-7 (&#34;Cease and Desist Ltd.).

On 21/10/17, MTF Tau-7 was successful in breaching SCP-5802-1 (then SCP-5802-4). Due to the casualty of all team members, it is currently unknown what happened within SCP-5802-4, save for a telepathic transmission from a former MTF Omega-8 team member:

We won. We fucking //won//.

They both put up a hell of a fight. They were trying to summon something, some god of pollution and industry. I could hear it trying to claw its way out of the gateway. Everything about it sounded... //oily// and- and //wrong//. I can still hear it now.

Carter and Dark, they were both long gone to that thing&#39;s will. I tried to establish a connection with them, and their minds... they were just screaming. The same two words over and over, //&#39;Stop us&#39;//.

When they died, the gateway began collapsing. Gonna take all of us with it when it does, a lethal dose of Akiva radiation to everything in a 1km radius. 

Kieran says that he&#39;s going to make sure we don&#39;t get corrupted along with everyone else that&#39;s died. I hope he can manage it.

Foundation. We&#39;ve already died in this darkness. So please, continue your work to preserve the light. For all of us.
