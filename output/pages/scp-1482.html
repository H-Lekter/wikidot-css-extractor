**Item #:** SCP-1482

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Site-178 has been built around SCP-1482, with the cover story that the Site is a retirement home for elderly individuals affected by dementia. A chain-link fence around the perimeter with CCTV monitoring is to be maintained.  Any unauthorised individuals attempting to access Site-178 are to be detained, interviewed and – if they present no clear threat – released after being provided with a Class-C amnestic.

**Description:** SCP-1482 is a structure resembling a residential building located in ██████, Shetland, Scotland.

SCP-1482 appears to be composed entirely of several-hundred objects not typically used in construction (collectively referred to as SCP-1482-1) attached together with string, rope, glue and conventional staples. These objects include: metallic objects such as knives, forks and sheet metal; wooden furniture; living, healthy and in some cases, partially vivisected specimens of //Bos primigenius// (domestic cattle), //Salmo salar// (Atlantic salmon), //Giraffa camelopardalis// (giraffe) and //Orcinus orca// (killer whale), as well as various members of the Orders Anura (frog) and Lophiiformes (angler fish). The living components of SCP-1482 have been determined to constitute under 10% (ten percent) of its parts, the rest consisting of non-living and artificial objects. These living specimens do not appear to require sustenance or excrete waste.

At 3 (three) known locations on SCP-1482, organs resembling human vocal cords are attached directly to an animal instance of SCP-1482-1 with staples; these vocal cords are identified as SCP-1482-2. Periodically, SCP-1482-2 will produce intelligible vocalisations in heavily slurred Scots English. The specific content of these vocalisations varies, but will typically involve one of the following:

* Complaints of being unable to see or hear, often with the mention that SCP-1482 can feel and smell in detail.

* Complaints of the interior of SCP-1482 feeling “cold”, “cald”, or in some cases, “baltic”.

* Requests that a non-specific listener enter SCP-1482 to warm it up, and provide company.

* Attempts to convince individuals who have entered SCP-1482 to stay indefinitely, make extended contact with the organic parts of SCP-1482 to confirm their presence, and protect the structure.

* Requests that individuals exiting SCP-1482 cease doing so. Exclamations of this nature tend to be shouted or yelled with increasing urgency.

* Screaming, distorted sounds of distress and assertions that if an individual who has recently exited SCP-1482 does not re-enter, &#34;the bad men” or “madmen” are &#34;gonnae come and have an empty[[footnote]]A term in Scots slang referring to youths hosting a party in their place of residence while their parents, carers or guardians are absent.[[/footnote]]”.

SCP-1482 was recovered from the custody of Group of Interest 3BA-Alpha-C (“the Chaos Insurgency”), following the group&#39;s evident attempts to manipulate SCP-1482’s anomalous properties to enable longevity and non-reliance on nutrition in humans. The organisation had  largely abandoned projects involving SCP-1482 by the time the Foundation became involved.

Analysis of files recovered from the CI have revealed limited information regarding SCP-1482. From these documents and the testimony of witnesses, it has been determined that SCP-1482 was the former residence of █████ K███████, noted zoology enthusiast, and that the vocal apparatus of the residence at one point functioned to provide information on various animal species. Ms. K███████ has yet to be located.

Further investigation has revealed that, prior to the involvement of the CI, the structure consisted exclusively of animal parts.
