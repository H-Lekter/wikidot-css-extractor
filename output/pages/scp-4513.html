**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4513 is contained in a standard object storage locker in Site-19.

**Description:** SCP-4513 is a Brush Master brand large drum wood-chipper. 

SCP-4513&#39;s anomalous quality occurs when any form of printed literary media is placed into its intake hopper. 

After SCP-4513 consumes such a form of media, rather than the expected output of shredded paper, it will produce a watery substance superficially resembling milk. This substance (SCP-4513-B) changes the narrative structure of any literary media it is exposed to. These alterations result in a text that more closely resembles the media SCP-4513-B was formed from (in style and prose).

&gt; Several tests were performed using SCP-4513-B. A filled IRS W-2 tax form, provided by Researcher Andrew Thompson, was used as a control for the different varieties of SCP-4513-B to be applied to.

The mahogany slab separating the captain from his sailor was littered with papers -- ink scrawls on parchment listing nills and tips and debts and payments, all resting on the broad white shoulders of one Captain Two-Form. Even as this cruel Pharoah of the Oppression scanned the page with his all seeing eyes, his flock trembled in awful fear at the utter power resting before him; the power to end a man&#39;s livelihood with a single stroke of a quill -- a weapon most desired, but entrusted to a small few under the watchful gaze of the Internal Revenue Service.

Jim Thompson&#39;s observation on the nature of his captor was cut short by the wax-sealed envelope thrust in his face by the thin, papery hands of Two-Form.

&#34;Eyes up, lad! You &#39;dun good, landing a one-hundredth-and-eightieth lay aboard the good ship //the Foundation// in only a single year of service! Not a feat many a man could accomplish. Though -- this has the unfortunate consequence of heightening the amount of coin good Father Samuel will tear from your grasp the moment we make landfall. However: I have a weapon most sinister that can aid you against him.&#34;

Two-Form grinned, displaying a mouth filled with shockingly white teeth, like a quarry of enamel buried under a disgusting facade.

&#34;Tell me, boy -- do you know what a deductible is?&#34;

Praytell, what is thy current level of income? **:W-2 FORM**

Jim Thompson fingered the wedding ring on his finger. The band had cost him a pretty penny, but it was far more beautiful than the marriage it had been for. Susan -- his wife -- was cold &amp; distant. She just didn&#39;t satisfy him anymore. Nothing did.

&#34;Jim?&#34;

HR Officer Form&#39;s musky voice snapped him out of his reverie. Jim stammered out a response, caught off-guard. &#34;Y-yes, Officer?&#34;

&#34;Call me Form. I&#39;d like to ask you a few questions - make sure you&#39;re suited to the position, you know.&#34;

&#34;I&#39;m suited for any position, sir!&#34;

The words had barely left Jim&#39;s mouth before he realized what he said. His face turned to crimson. Thankfully, either Form didn&#39;t notice, or he didn&#39;t mention it. 

//Stay focused, you idiot. Don&#39;t get distracted by his face, or his glasses, or his musc-//

&#34;How&#39;re the wife and kids, Jim? You got married last year, right?&#34;

//He remembered.//

&#34;W-we&#39;re good. We&#39;re going through a rough spot, but we&#39;ll make it.&#34;

&#34;Ah, sorry to hear that. This news should be a nice blow, though.&#34;

Form&#39;s face was the one turning red this time. They both let out polite chuckles, eager to change the topic at hand.

&#34;Haha, we&#39;re both just tripping over ourselves today, aren&#39;t we?&#34;

The air in the room was thick, stifling. Jim could feel the energy, the chemistry between them.

&#34;Well, sir, I know I am.&#34;

Again, they both tittered and giggled for a moment, before both looking up at the same instant. Their eyes met, and something passed between them. Jim held the connection a moment longer, but Form broke it off. But Form wasn&#39;t fooling anyone, least of all himself. Both of them knew what had changed in that instant.

Form fumbled, sweat dripping from his brow, as he handed Jim a sealed envelope. 

&#34;I-I&#39;m sorry, Thompson. We can&#39;t fully deduct that unfortunate hospital bill from January.&#34;

Now was the moment. Jim had to make a choice. Do or die. Make what might be the biggest mistake of his life, or go through the rest of his existence wondering what could have been.

He looked up, Form&#39;s eyes, and purred out a single sentence.

&#34;My copay isn&#39;t the only thing that&#39;s rising.&#34;
