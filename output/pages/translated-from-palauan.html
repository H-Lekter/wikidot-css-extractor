They&#39;ve stopped coming. They used to come four times a day, to feed me, to keep me furnished, sometimes to test me. It was horrible some days, especially when they slipped up and I started hurting. But they used to come. Now the room&#39;s dirty beyond belief, all the electronics have stopped working, and the hurting won&#39;t stop. Why aren&#39;t they coming?

It&#39;s getting dark, too. Did they cut the power? Or is that me blacking out? Or the burning fluid getting in my eyes? I don&#39;t like the dark; it scares me, it has all the feelings that hurt me in it. I want them to bring back the lights.

I&#39;ve tried the door a few times. I thought the burning stuff would eat through it if they had turned the power off, but it only hurt me. I can&#39;t force the lock. There&#39;s no other way out. Everything&#39;s decaying around me, and I&#39;m feeling worse, and I feel bad about that and I&#39;m hurting myself more and more.

It must be really bad out there; I&#39;m hurting more than my own emotions could make me. I used to burn every so often, but now I do it everyday. My skin feels like it&#39;s peeling off, and I can&#39;t even scream sometimes, because my throat&#39;s so clogged up. I need them to come back. I need them to make the burning stop.

And my head hurts. Not like the burning stuff makes it hurt, but like there&#39;s a vice on it. Something&#39;s squeezing my head in, taking my memories. It&#39;s like there&#39;s a giant sponge in the walls, eating away at everything I am. But that&#39;s not possible. They said the things they put in the walls stop me from hurting.

Why can&#39;t I remember my name?

They told me they&#39;re always watching. They //know// I&#39;m suffering. In the past, when I hurt, they came and saved me. But now, I just hurt alone.

It&#39;s like they threw me away because I&#39;m not good enough.

John. You brought me here. Please, get me out.
