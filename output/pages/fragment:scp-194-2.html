    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>**Item #:** SCP-194

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-194 is contained in a standard anomalous object locker.

**Description:** SCP-194 is a regulation-size volleyball.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Addenda 194.A-194.C: Documentation of SCP-194-Z&#34; hide=&#34;Close&#34;]]

**Addendum 194.A (Object Class):** Euclid

**Addendum 194.B (Special Containment Procedures):** The object presently designated SCP-194 is contained in a concrete mausoleum located in a New Orleans cemetery, the location of which is included in attached file 194-LOC-A. The mausoleum is to be checked for damage or deterioration once every 30 days. Any reality-restructuring effects of SCP-194 which appear to impact the space outside of it should be reported to containment staff. 

Due to the effects of SCP-194-Z upon the SCP-194 designation, the acting documentation of SCP-194-Z is presented in the form of various addenda to the acting SCP-194 designation. Any secondary classifications are to be assigned in reverse alphabetical order (i.e. SCP-194-Z), and all addenda are to be designated alphabetically, rather than numerically (i.e. Addendum 194.A). This is to prevent conflict with documentation applied to the SCP-194 designation.

Despite changes to the SCP-194 designation, Addenda 194.A through 194.C describe the true nature of SCP-194-Z, and will remain unaltered regardless of other edits.

**Addendum 194.C (Description):** SCP-194-Z refers to a phenomenon surrounding the SCP-194 designation. Various objects are assigned to the SCP-194 designation at various times, causing the SCP-194 file to be altered based on the affected object. Only one object can be assigned to the SCP-194 slot at any time, causing minor retroactive alterations to support the containment of each object in Foundation custody.

Notably, most affected objects assigned to the SCP-194 designation are non-anomalous in nature.

&gt; Dear Laura,
&gt;
&gt; I still like you and I want something to happen between us. I know you think I don’t care, and that I don’t think about people, but I really, really do. And I care about you most of all. To prove it, am going to make something for you: a collage of all the amazing things about you, to show what a unique and amazing person you are!
