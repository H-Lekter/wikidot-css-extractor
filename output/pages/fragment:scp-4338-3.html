**Special Containment Procedures:** ##blue|Aquatic Research Vessel //Herron// will remain anchored off of Moaha Island. Once per calendar month, the following items must be deposited into this island&#39;s volcanic crater:##

* ##blue|1500kg Cookies (Low-cost Bulk)## 
* ##blue|1200kg Potato Chips (Low-cost Bulk)##
* ##blue|1000kg Chocolate (Low-cost Bulk)##
* ##blue|1400kg Pork, any variety.##
* ##blue|1000kg Chicken, any variety.##
* ##blue|1300kg Beef, any variety.## 

**Description:** ##grey|SCP-4338 is a sapient, levitating,## ##blue|7.3km^^3^^## ##grey|sphere of volcanic rock ## ##blue|contained within## ##grey|the magma chamber beneath Moaha Island. Multiple artifacts and oral traditions reference this entity as &#34;Ōsobiue&#34;, &#34;Irn&#39;acha&#34;, or &#34;God of the Burning Ocean&#34;: a central figure in the creation myths -- and extinction events -- of some 19 early oceanic cultures.## ##blue| SCP-4338 will absorb any edible matter that comes into contact with the lava on Moaha Island. An ongoing regimen of calorie-dense food has proven effective in neutralizing SCP-4338&#39;s mobility and aggressive tendencies. Prior to these containment protocols, SCP-4338 was capable of both exiting the Moaha Volcano, and producing animated, artificial duplicates of human corpses that share its consciousness. The last of these &#34;proxies&#34;, former Director Morgan Rowell, is contained aboard A.R.V. //Herron//.##

##blue|Use of SCP-4338 for the disposal of slaughterhouse trimmings, industrial runoff, and all other edible waste-products is under consideration.##

[[collapsible show=&#34;Interview Log 01/10/2019 - Rowell / 4338&#34; hide=&#34;Interview Log 01/10/2019 - Rowell / 4338&#34;]]

&gt; **Foreword:** Within the last year, rocky growths across the Rowell / 4338 body have vastly increased, now covering 78% of the epidermis. All interviews are now conducted within Rowell / 4338&#39;s containment chamber, as they have not moved from a slumped, seated position in 6 months.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewed:** Morgan Rowell/SCP-4338
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Director Amelia Thornborrow
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; **Thornborrow:** Hello 4338. How are you today?
&gt; 
&gt; //Rowell / 4338 does not respond.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Thornborrow:** Any issues with our current offerings?
&gt; 
&gt; //Rowell / 4338 does not look up at Director Thornborrow, only shrugging in response. This creates a grating sound, and causes several chunks of rock and dust to fall from their shoulders.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Thornborrow:** Very well. I&#39;ll check in again next month.
&gt; 
&gt; //Director Thornborrow moves to leave the containment cell when Rowell / 4338 is heard speaking, near inaudibly.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Rowell / 4338:** What have you done to me?
&gt; 
&gt; //Director Thornborrow looks back at Rowell/4338.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Thornborrow:** Hm? …I’m sorry, did you say something?
&gt; 
&gt; //Rowell / 4338 remains immobile and silent for another several seconds, then gradually lifting their head to look at Director Thornborrow.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Rowell / 4338:** …You poison me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Thornborrow:** I assure you, everything we’ve offered you, everything you’ve //personally// requested, has been safe to eat.
&gt; 
&gt; **Rowell / 4338:** …A devious poison then… you could not kill my body, so you killed my ambition… I should... I should have destroyed you all... the moment you arrived...
&gt; 
&gt; **Thornborrow:** Yes, well, hindsight and all that. Are we done here?
&gt; 
&gt; //Rowell / 4338’s head falls to one side. A chunk of their ear, now entirely volcanic rock, falls apart.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Rowell / 4338:** …You no longer fear me, do you? … Do you even consider me a God? … Did you ever?
&gt; 
&gt; //Thornborrow remains silent. Rowell/4338 slowly nods.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Rowell / 4338:** … Long ago, I was met by great, wooden barges flying sheets of white… the men aboard wore fine silks, and plates of metal…  I attacked them before they even touched my shore… who were they to fashion iron?... Only I deserved such power… but they fled, so I knew they still feared me at least... but then, so soon after, you and your S C P arrived… now, even your ships are made of metal… you know so many secrets of earth and sky… yet you still made offerings… I thought you still worshiped me... feared me... should have known then… should have… killed you...
&gt; 
&gt; //Rowell / 4338 continues mumbling lower than the recorder can pick up. Director Thornborrow tucks a strand of hair behind her ear.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Thornborrow:** If you have any more requests, don’t hesitate to ask us, 4338.
&gt; 
&gt; //Thornborrow moves to the doorway.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Rowell / 4338:** Perhaps... perhaps more of the... sweet wafers...
&gt; 
&gt; //Thornborrow looks back over her shoulder. Just before re-sealing the containment chamber, she makes a short, sweeping bow.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Thornborrow:** Your servant.
