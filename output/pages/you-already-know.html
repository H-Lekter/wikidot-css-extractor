Mikell Bright quietly shuts the door to Jack Bright&#39;s office. &#34;Brother.&#34;

Jack continues to fill out the paperwork sitting on his desk, eyes firmly downwards. &#34;Brother.&#34;

The silence that settles between them is far more awkward on Mikell&#39;s end.

After several very long moments, Jack looks up. &#34;What do you need?&#34; His pen doesn&#39;t lift from the paper.

Mikell can&#39;t quite make eye contact. &#34;I&#39;m sure you heard about my promotion.&#34;

&#34;Of course I did. I&#39;m technically not supposed to know, but we&#39;re family.&#34;

&#34;Word does travel that way.&#34;

Every conversation they&#39;ve never had hangs in the air. They&#39;re only about ten feet apart, only a couple strides away from physical contact, only a conversation away from what they&#39;re both really feeling.

&#34;Six. That&#39;s a pretty nice position.&#34; Jack looks down at his half-finished sentence, then back up at his brother. &#34;You&#39;re a lucky guy. Moved up pretty quick.&#34; 

There&#39;s years of bitterness in eight words. Mikell resists the urge to fidget with something. &#34;Yeah. I&#39;m pretty lucky.&#34;

&#34;Do you know who&#39;s taking your place?&#34; 

&#34;Not yet. I just got the news an hour ago.&#34; There&#39;s something about the way Jack is looking at him that makes Mikell want to hide. He keeps up the facade of being unbothered, back straight, hands quietly by his sides. &#34;They gave me a few hours to collect my things and say my goodbyes. I assume I&#39;m never going to see you again.&#34;

&#34;I assume so.&#34;

&#34;How...&#34; Mikell swallows and closes his eyes. When they reopen, the room is the same. &#34;How long have you known?&#34;

&#34;A few days.&#34; There might be pity in Jack&#39;s eyes. It&#39;s hard to tell. &#34;Before you did, I suppose. Our father told me about the decision. He knows these things, you know.&#34;

&#34;I know.&#34;

&#34;It&#39;s a figure of speech.&#34;

&#34;I know.&#34; Mikell has to put his hands in his pockets. Even then, his fingers twist around themselves in an attempt to feel something other than what&#39;s right in front of him. &#34;I just... I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m ready.&#34;

&#34;Of course you&#39;re ready.&#34; Jack&#39;s pen moves neatly to finally finish his thought, and then continues on to his next ones. &#34;You wouldn&#39;t be promoted if you weren&#39;t.&#34;

&#34;Okay. Fine.&#34; Mikell takes a deep breath. &#34;I don&#39;t feel ready.&#34;

&#34;You will.&#34;

&#34;How do you know?&#34;

&#34;Because you&#39;re Mikell.&#34; Jack&#39;s words are so matter-of-fact and so, so painful. &#34;Because you&#39;ve already accepted the position. Because you&#39;re standing in front of me doing a shit job at saying goodbye.&#34;

&#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34; Mikell has to consciously breathe. &#34;I&#39;m not very good at words.&#34;

&#34;I know.&#34; 

&#34;Goodbye doesn&#39;t really cut it, though, does it?&#34;

&#34;It never really has.&#34; Jack finally sets his pen down and fully looks up from his paperwork. &#34;Mikell...&#34;

&#34;Yeah?&#34; There&#39;s a plea somewhere in there.

&#34;Thank you for stopping by.&#34;

&#34;You&#39;re the only one of us I could on such short notice.&#34;

&#34;Doesn&#39;t matter. You still thought of me.&#34;

This time, the silence between them isn&#39;t filled with knives.

The two of them make eye contact, and Mikell speaks. &#34;Am I the right man for the job?&#34;

Jack pauses and looks at the floor before answering. &#34;Are you?&#34;

There&#39;s no response Mikell can give.

&#34;Go finish packing.&#34; Jack picks his pen back up. &#34;You&#39;ve got a big life ahead of you.&#34;

&#34;I&#39;ll miss you.&#34;

&#34;Go pack.&#34;

Mikell leaves the office as quietly as he came in.

He does not cry.</textarea></pre>
