&gt; **Date:** ██/██/████
&gt; **Test Material:**  Toy jet plane
&gt; 
&gt; //Results:// The toy was replaced by a full-sized F-16 which attempted to take off inside the testing facility, causing a great deal of damage.  The debris quickly turned back to plastic, and [[[SCP-137]]]&#39;s current form reanimated.
&gt; 
&gt; //Notes:// In the future, please avoid testing materials that come equipped with jet engines and missiles.  This was an expensive test.


&gt; **Date:** ██/██/████
&gt; **Test Material:** ███ ██████ brand racecar.
&gt; 
&gt; //Results:// The toy was replaced by a full-sized Ferrari that attempted to race around the testing facility, ultimately crashing into the wall at high speed.  Again, the debris turned back to plastic, and SCP-137&#39;s current form was reanimated.
&gt; 
&gt; //Notes:// Vehicle tests now require permission from Director ████████


&gt; **Date:** ██/██/████
&gt; **Test Material:** An alligator key-chain fob, attached to Agent Sorenson&#39;s keys.
&gt; 
&gt; //Results:// A six-meter-long saltwater crocodile in a hallway.  Fourteen dead.
&gt; 
&gt; //Notes:// All agents must now be searched for toys or toy-like items before entering site ██.


&gt; **Date:** ██/██/████
&gt; **Test Material:** █████ brand &#34;American Soldier&#34; action figure.
&gt; 
&gt; //Results:// The toy was replaced by an adult male human in a soldier&#39;s fatigues, carrying a large rifle, which managed to kill five personnel before being terminated.
&gt; 
&gt; //Notes:// Let&#39;s try something less violent next time.


&gt; **Date:** ██/██/████
&gt; **Test Material:** ██████ brand Officer Jones beat cop action figure. 
&gt; 
&gt; //Results:// An adult male in a policeman&#39;s uniform.  It kept asking where the &#34;perps&#34; had gone to, and insisting that researchers not take recreational pharmaceuticals.  After interrogation attempts, it announced that the researchers were criminals, shot two, and handcuffed a third before being terminated.


&gt; **Date:** ██/██/████
&gt; **Test Material:** A stuffed panda.
&gt; 
&gt; //Results:// A very large panda. It is to be noted that, despite their &#34;cute&#34; appearance and herbivorous lifestyle, pandas are still bears.  It proceeded to hug one of the researchers, breaking three ribs before it was terminated.


&gt; **Date:** ██/██/████
&gt; **Test Material:** A box of ████ plastic construction bricks.
&gt; 
&gt; //Results:// A terracotta brick appeared inside the box.  It vanished, replaced by a brick of a different material.  This went on for several hours before the items were destroyed and the anomaly reanimated its current host.


&gt; **Date:** ██/██/████
&gt; **Test Material:** A ███████ brand yo-yo.
&gt; 
&gt; //Results:// The yo-yo did not change form.  However, it became autonomous, moving on its own and performing a variety of tricks, even when removed from the finger of a researcher and placed on a hook in the wall.


&gt; **Date:** ██/██/████
&gt; **Test Material:** A ██████ brand Doctor Selenium action figure, noted on the packaging to be &#34;The Smartest Man on Earth.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; //Results:// An adult male in a lab coat.  It made repeated references to its &#34;astounding intellect.&#34;  However, when questioned on any scientific or mathematical knowledge, it would not answer directly, only saying that it was the &#34;smartest man on Earth.&#34;  Testing ended after several hours of fruitless questioning.

&gt; **Date:** ██/██/████
&gt; **Test Material:** A ████████████████ winged unicorn toy from the ██████████████ line, based on a popular children&#39;s televison show.
&gt;
&gt; //Results:// A small disproportionately figured purple equine matching ████████████████&#39;s coloration and additional limbs. Junior Researcher █████ asked SCP-137 questions about its adopted character and about its &#39;magical&#39; capabilities, but was answered only with cheerful non-sequitur statements. This included asking about Junior Researcher █████&#39;s friends, declaring that &#39;friendship is the greatest magic&#39;, and requesting he fly to the castle with her, despite Junior Researcher █████&#39;s lack of wings, and SCP-137&#39;s lack of a castle. Testing ended within an hour.
&gt;
&gt; //Notes:// Junior Researcher █████, in light of this interaction, has been removed from SCP-137 testing, and officially reprimanded regarding using SCP objects to try to indulge his personal interests.</textarea></pre>
