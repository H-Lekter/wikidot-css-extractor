&#34;Uh, hi. If you&#39;re watching this, then I guess you, or maybe that should be &#39;we&#39;, survived. And  yes, I really am you. Look, this is my... your... our face. No makeup or anything, this isn&#39;t a mask. Uh, if you want more proof, then, uh... you grew up in Fairfield, Connecticut. Your house had that green door you could spot a mile away. You were jealous of the neighbor kid, Ben or Toby or something like that, because he had a dog but dad refused because you could barely take care of a goldfish, right? You went through like five of those suckers in a month once. So yeah. This is me - you - making a video recording for you, in my future. It&#39;s... yeah. It&#39;s complicated.

I don&#39;t know how much you&#39;ll remember, but you shouldn&#39;t remember making this recording and that&#39;s expected. Because you, and everyone who was with you, needed to forget in order to make the trick work. Which means, I guess, that even if things went according to plan a lot of people died not really knowing why. But now that it&#39;s over you deserve to know the truth. What I&#39;m going to tell you is going to sound cruel, but remember: you volunteered for this. And if you&#39;re the same person as I am, making this recording, then you know why. The truth is this: you and everyone else at [http://www.scp-wiki.net/operation-hippodrome Provisional Site 324] needed to lose that fight so the Church of the Broken God could make off with that spaceship you were guarding. Which... sounds a lot like the situation that got us into this mess. But... at least this time it&#39;s deliberate, I guess. Anyway.

You were told that you were guarding an anomalous spacecraft that the Church absolutely must not get its hands on. That isn&#39;t even half the truth. What you were guarding was a fake spaceship based off of a real spaceship that the Foundation wanted the Church to steal. We needed them to steal it so that they&#39;d think their machine-god came from outer space or something so that... honestly I don&#39;t know too much. This is just what they told me. Because at least it&#39;s fair to volunteer for a suicide mission as long as you know what&#39;s really going on. Or something. And I wasn&#39;t really paying a whole lot of attention. A suicide mission sounded good to make up for our mistake, right? I guess we&#39;ve always had a something of a guilt complex. And the way it was described to me it was a suicide mission. You probably got system malfunctions at the worst times, right? And the armory was drastically understocked, yeah? Yeah. Suicide mission. 

So anyway that&#39;s the story. You and your friends were made to forget what they&#39;d signed up for and set up to die so that some religious cyborgs can steal a fake spaceship. They said the world was stranger than we thought when we signed up, but I didn&#39;t think it would be this fucked-up, you know?

Actually... I don&#39;t even know if you&#39;re watching this having accomplished your mission. Maybe you survived but they didn&#39;t take the bait or something. I guess a couple of people would have died anyway, right? God, that would suck six ways to Sunday. Dying and not really knowing why and not even succeeding...

Anyway. I have some amnestics to take. See you on the other side.&#34;</textarea></pre>
