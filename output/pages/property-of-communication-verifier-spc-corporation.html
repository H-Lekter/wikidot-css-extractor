I remember what it was like before this, but I keep on forgetting. Even when I remember.

I don&#39;t know how I remember, I simply do. The world has gone wrong; we have opened the Box. I do not know what the Box is, but I remember when the world was right. I remember when we fed bread to pigeons, not flying saucers. I remember when three came after two. I remember when South America didn&#39;t belong to Play-Dough soldiers.

This world cannot last long, how can it? Even the White House is bigger on the inside, because of...I can&#39;t remember. It is getting harder to remember what it was like before. One...eighty...four, I think. Yes, it must have been. What is that? I have to keep my memories together, I write them down, you see. So I can remember what it was like.

I don&#39;t think I worked at Salvicot Private Communications before we opened the Box. What is the Box? All I know is that we opened it. Who is //we//, for that matter? Fuck, my head hurts. It hurts to remember, I want to forget. This world is fine, I can settle for this. 

The world is not fine. I know this, it&#39;s my job. Look at all the information everywhere, every day. Let me see, let me see...here we go, straight from Russia. //Meat Contagion strikes in Aleysk, hundreds dead//. There are pictures, too; a bit red, but we can edit it for page three hundred and seventy-six, I think. No, we can&#39;t, I have to remember. But why won&#39;t I forget?

We opened the Box and everything changed. For worse, for better? I don&#39;t remember, but I don&#39;t forget. This one&#39;s from the Immortal City. Funny folks, pay Mr. Salvicot a lot for child shipments. Or so you hear. And I hear everything. 

Anyway, back to the news, //Father of thirty-three dead, Blind involvement suspected.// Suspected? It&#39;s all but certain. His eyes were closed and his neck was broken. Shit and blood all over the house. I hope the American Empire had a good reason for letting that thing loose. 

It should have been contained. Like the Box. I think I remember who I am now. I am me. You can&#39;t close the Box. The Box is open and the Box is gone. We just have to carry on living.

Time to pack up for home, I suppose. My daughter&#39;s got a case of the clockworks, perhaps I&#39;ll get her a Mr. Headless.
