There was a containment breach at 9AM at Site-51.

------

I was told about it at 11AM that same day. Came through the usual channel of the inter-site emergency response system. It sat in my inbox for about twenty minutes before I stopped working on my most recent report to open it up.

&#34;Thirteen dead. Four in critical condition. Anomaly recontained.&#34;

It took me a while to close the email and get back to work. Couldn’t tell you why. I’d gotten emails like this dozens of times. I don’t know though. Something about the numbers stuck with me for a bit. 

I cracked open a window to let some fresh air in. The entire sky was grey, but it refused to rain even a drop. Maybe it was out of respect. Maybe the clouds were sapient. I’d never know. I stared at them for a long time.

------

At around 1PM I got lunch with my colleagues. The first thing they asked me was if I had heard the news, which of course I had. Then they asked if I knew anyone over at the site. I shook my head. 

&#34;Not unless someone got transferred. Janice is at 81 and Gabriel has been stuck at 33 for three years.&#34;

The others nodded, and then we ate in silence for a little bit.

&#34;Didn’t Richard Wethers get transferred to 51 a few months ago?&#34; Dr. Tennison asked. 

&#34;Yeah, he did,&#34; Dr. Gerdinel replied, &#34;I called him a few hours ago, but he didn’t pick up.&#34;

&#34;Probably lost his phone in the breach,&#34; I said.

&#34;Or maybe something locked up there messes with cell lines,&#34; someone else added.

We ate in silence for a little longer before someone changed the subject.

------

At 3PM someone knocked on the door to my office. It was Tennison. His face was blank, but I could hear some quiet weeping down the hall. 

&#34;We’re having a small gathering for Richard,&#34; he said. I nodded and followed him to the cafeteria. Thirteen others stood in a circle. Some of them were crying. Others just looked down and shook their heads. I didn’t really know Richard all that well. We sometimes complained about the commute together, and we had a nice conversation during the site-wide Christmas party last year about the pros and cons of using he/she/they pronouns for humanoid anomalies. 

Someone said a few words, and then we all stood in silence for a little while. I don’t remember if we had done this before, or if this was the first time someone from our site had been killed in a breach since I transferred here. I bowed my head with everyone else and tried to say a few words. They felt hollow. But then again, I didn’t really know the guy.

------

I got home at 5PM. I was tired, so I collapsed onto the couch and turned on the news.

&#34;Eleven dead in Pittsburgh Synagogue shooting. Multiple injured. Suspect in custody.&#34;

I turned off the TV, and just sat there in the dark.</textarea></pre>
