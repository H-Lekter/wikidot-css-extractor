**Hub Hotel:** A large scale hub project about a temporary transfer site for humanoid anomalies that uses an experimental SRA (TBD… maybe an actual Thaumiel Reality Bender) to make the anomalies think they are guests of a luxury hotel for an overnight stay. However, the site director is more concerned with becoming an anomaly then containing them. Experimental entry : “173 Goes on Staycation” to come soon.
