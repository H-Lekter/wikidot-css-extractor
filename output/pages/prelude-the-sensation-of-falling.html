&gt; &#34;...tellin&#39; me I live inna world where silly fucks don&#39;t let their own children receive medication because some asshat on a talk show told them not to, and you wanna know how my day is goin&#39;? lemme tell ya, bea- no, thanks, I can&#39;t drink anymore, heart condition- lemme tell ya...&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; The guy on my left keeps talking to the woman across from me as I order a can of ginger ale from a flight attendant with an enormous nose. It&#39;s the third hour of a seven hour flight, and I already want to just jump. The attendant gives me a can and cup of ice and moves on before I can ask for a napkin, which I suppose is just par for the course.
&gt; 
&gt; My name is Stephen, and I am a commercial writer bound for Shanghai from San Diego. I&#39;m writing all this down to keep myself amused on my journey- if it comes out entertaining, I may pass it on as a travelogue to some magazine and make a few bucks. So far, though, it looks like the chances of anything interesting happening ar
&gt; 
&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; Adrift at sea on an airline life raft. This is the sort of shit you see in movies. I never expected it to happen to me. While it&#39;s fresh in my mind, I&#39;ll write out what happened.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;d just gotten my drink when the front half of the plane disappeared. I know that sounds crazy. It is crazy. But that&#39;s what happened, I fucking saw it. I was in seat 23B. Everything beyond two rows ahead of me just vanished with a rush of exploding pressurized air, leaving a yawning view of empty blue sky that tilted all too fast into approaching clouds and the howling rush of free fall. From the looks of the spray of blood I glimpsed before I passed out, the whole row&#39;s legs went with it, like they&#39;d been cut by God&#39;s own invisible scalpel. I instinctively rammed my notebook back into my briefcase and like a moron started to raise the tray table when the lack of oxygen and adrenalin put me to sleep.
&gt; 
&gt;  I woke to impact, as what remained of the plane hit the water and threw me hard into the seat in front of me. I had just enough time to gulp for air before the water rushed over me to fill the cabin.
&gt; 
&gt; I dunno who thought to pull the raft and toss it out of the plane, but I hope that crazy bastard got a hero&#39;s welcome in heaven. It was floating there waiting when I surfaced, briefcase deathgripped in my hand. I flipped it right side up and clambered into it. That&#39;s when I blacked out for the second time.
&gt; 
&gt; Eventually, one of the other survivors woke me up. There are seven of us. The one who&#39;s at the front of the raft says there&#39;s a small island ahead and we&#39;re moving toward it, but it&#39;s going twilight now and we may miss it in the dark. I hope we don&#39;t miss it.
&gt;
