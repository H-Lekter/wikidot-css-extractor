//This is an essay on how to establish your own author insert on the site. A special thanks to VSauce for voicing this episode.//

Hello, my dear skippers. Please, have a seat.

Did you catch it? Your lesson has already begun.

You see, I am not [[*user Calibri Bold]], as some of you may believe. I am actually Dr. Calvin Bold, the author insert of Calibri Bold. It&#39;s a little technique I like to call &#34;movie magic&#34;.

Let&#39;s talk about deserts. Or rather, dunes. J Dune, to be precise. Or his beautiful insert, Doctor Dune? Have I ever talked about how handsome he is? But that&#39;s a conversation for another time.

You see, some of you may consider yourselves to be experts on author inserts. Bright, Clef, Kondraki, all those folks. But they&#39;re not cool, not as cool as someone like Gekkoguy. But what does it //mean// to be an author insert?

Well, an author insert is //you//. It&#39;s what you are in the world of SCP. But unlike //you//, because //you// suck, your author avatar is cool and can be whatever you want it to be, and by extension, makes you cooler. For instance, your author insert could be a slim, fashionable, talented super-spy, who recently engaged in sexual intercourse with your bully&#39;s mother, while you are a 14-year-old hoping that nobody on a creative writing website finds out you&#39;re too young to be here. But in the realm of fiction, you //become// the sexy super-spy.

But that&#39;s silly, right? I mean, it&#39;s not like writing a character named after you actually makes you cooler.

Or does it?

Let&#39;s go back to Dune. Studies have shown that J Dune, a brilliant author and a fine contest judge, is well known for his incredible handsomeness and brilliant intellect. But what if I told you that this is only the beginning? That by making himself an author insert, J Dune has in fact become cooler?

That would be silly, of course. J Dune can&#39;t be improved upon. He&#39;s like Gekkoguy (absolute genius, by the way), or Varaxous (handsome devil, I should mention, and a terrific artist). There&#39;s just no way to improve on perfection.

But can we even reach perfection?

No, of course not. We&#39;re not inordinately talented and tasteful contest judges. But within the realm of author inserts, we can always //create// our perfect selves. For instance, I, Dr. Calvin Bold, am actually immortal and have SCP-682&#39;s powers. Why is this the case? Because it&#39;s been established in canon. //This// canon, in fact. The one you&#39;re reading. Now it&#39;s true, and of course, I&#39;m so much cooler for it. I am an incredibly sexy and handsome individual (thought not as sexy or handsome as our dear contest runners), so much so that I was once hired to play Calibri Bold, an individual well-known for being sexy and handsome. Now, with this power, my beauty only grows, as does my power. Already I&#39;ve made myself unkillable with a popular SCP&#39;s superpowers.

You see, I can control the universe from here. Though I&#39;ll never be as sexy as someone like Varaxous, I can still pull the strings. And now I&#39;ll pull the strings for you as well.

Any statement made regarding your own author insert in this page&#39;s discussion is now canon.

Thank you for coming.
