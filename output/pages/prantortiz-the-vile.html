++ Baseline

**P&#39;rantortiz is a malevolent** ##FF007F|humanish-shaped## **##purple|„pıouɐɯnɥ„ uɐǝɯ noʎ ǝʌıǝlǝq ı##** ##FF007F|Woah. Who let Bizarro in here?## ##blue|Can we not? This is a serious matter.## **entity. A high-ranking demon knight. It possesses intimate knowledge of ancient and esoteric magicks, is supremely cunning, and invariably hostile.** ##FF007F|Likes include: subjugation of the populace, torture or extermination of those who resist, debauched sex parties,  and Homestuck. So like, literally the worst type of--## **##blue|Enough.##**

++ Prerequisites

**Unknown, aside from the presence of one or more of the Abrahamic faiths.** ##FF007F|The only sensible thing to do is ban religion, of course!## 


++ Vulnerability

##blue|This is what we&#39;re here to determine. We know that holy water has an adverse effect on it, but it isn&#39;t exactly enough to disable the demon completely.  A combination of religious enchantments and/or tactics may suffice in holding him permanently.## ##green|We need to figure out what that precise combination is.##

-----
++ Instance: Timeline Q-001:

##blue|My home, and the reason I requested a catalogue for this prick. The majority of the population has been enslaved. The remainder has been driven underground, and are hunted by The Beast&#39;s minions. I&#39;ve personally poured through the Library&#39;s archives, searching for something, anything that may put a stop to its reign of terror. Something to give my people a reason to keep fighting.##  **##purple|˙ʎɹɹos os ɯɐ I##** **I&#39;m certain we will come across something.** ##FF007F|You know, you could always come bunk with me! A bad spell turned like, 90% of my timeline into ice-cream and waffles!## **##purple|ƃuıʇsnƃsıp##** ##blue|I&#39;ll pass, thanks.## ##green|Wait. I thought your timeline was the one filled with indestructible kittens?## ##FF007F|[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2559-j|Yea]]], that was like, four timelines ago. I need to move a lot.##

++ Instance: Timeline Q-343:

##green|Manipulated several world leaders via occult means into initiating a series of armed conflicts; culminating in out-and-out nuclear warfare. Billions perished in the exchange. The demon&#39;s whereabouts are unknown.## **##purple|¿uoıʇɐpunoℲ ǝɥʇ##** ##green|Dissolved. Testimony from one of their escapees suggests that their leadership was similarly compromised.## **##purple|˙uɯɐp##** ##FF007F|Is this just like, &#39;your thing&#39; to be edgy and mysterious, or are faces in your dimension upside-down? If it&#39;s the latter, I&#39;ve got a friend in the circus I could hook you up with.## ##green|She&#39;s a Khôramancer, dear. ## **##purple|˙pǝɹıʇǝɹ ı ˙sɐʍ*##** **An unfortunate side-affect of toying with the Void.**

++ Instance: Timeline H-522:

##green|Much more low-key here. He possessed a human; a famous pornographer. Produced a series of films in which his crew ritualistically murdered his performers after the &#39;act&#39;. Viewers become compelled to replicate their actions. The Foundation confiscated all physical copies, and labelled him as a Person of Interest. Currently at large.## ##FF007F|Totally called the &#39;sex party&#39; thing.## ##blue|Gnosis. She&#39;s being rather unproductive. Do you mind?## **Not at all.** 

+++++ Black Queen Lilly has been banished (Do return when you have something meaningful to contribute.)

++ Instance: Timeline J-280:

**##purple|˙uʍop ǝıן oʇ pǝǝu I ˙sɯɐǝɹɔs ʇnq ʇɟǝן ƃuıɥʇou ˙pɐǝp ןןɐ##** ##blue|I&#39;ve seen its treachery first-hand. Take all the time you need, Vertigo.## 


++ Instance: Timeline K-999:

##green|GOC forces raided the stronghold of a cult based around the entity.## **Excellent.** ##green|Slaughtered his followers to a man.## ##blue|I like where this is going.## ##green|Unfortunately their deaths acted as the catalyst to an Alpha-Tier working.## **##purple|¿ǝɔuɐpuǝɔsɐ uɐ##**  ##green|Exactly. None can get within a mile of it without spontaneously combusting. If the subject does indeed have a weakness, it won&#39;t be found in this iteration.## **That is rather troublesome**. ##blue|How many timelines have fallen to this Beast?##


++ Instance: Timeline L-761:

##FF007F|Guess who&#39;s back bitches!## **##purple|¿sısouƃ##** ##green|Again with this?## **Say your piece.** ##FF007F|Right. Ahem.##

##FF007F|Target is in the Foundation&#39;s custody.## ##blue|Well, that certainly is a step in the right direction, but they&#39;re not always the best at handling these things.## ##FF007F|Oh. It gets better. See, not only do they have the fucker under lock and key, but--## **##purple|˙ƃuıɟɟnןq ǝɹ,noʎ##** ##green|I&#39;m with her. Considering your previous behavior, we&#39;ll need something more solid than just your word.##  ##FF007F|Good thing ol&#39; Lilly&#39;s got proof! pic: cuz it totally happened!## [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4357-j|Open attachment]]]

##blue|Lilly, I love you.## **The idiocy displayed here is remarkable.** ##green|This is gold.## **##purple|˙ʞɹoʍ ʇuǝllǝɔxǝ##** ##FF007F|Now that we&#39;ve got this out of the way... I&#39;ve got a few hundred billion-trillion light-years filled with deliciousness just begging to be eaten. :) ## ##green|Sounds like a plan.## **I do think we all deserve the break.****##purple| ¿pǝɹoʌɐlɟ-ʇuıɯ ǝɹǝɥʇ sı##** ##blue|Count me in!##</textarea></pre>
