I wake up. I get out of bed. I look at the clock. I drink water. I brush my teeth. 
[[/=]]

Going through the motions, time pushes and pulls through them. I shouldn’t be surprised, it’s always like this. Time catches up with me, but it’s after the monotonous drive to the site. Nothing I do really feels like me though. I’m not doing it, but I clearly am. The longer I think, the longer I realize how long it’s been like this. Going through the motions, none of it being me. 

[[&gt;]]
It’s you.
[[/&gt;]]

Everything feels so foreign to me. The hallways I absentmindedly walk, the office I work in, the SCP I’m researching. Nothing feels right, but… it is? Maybe it’s just a bad day, or the aftereffects of a particular experiment. There&#39;s a clawing at my mind, but it’s dull. A pounding on my chest.

[[=]]
I sigh. I research. I move. I research.
[[/=]]

My mind is blank, it never used to be. I didn’t do much work, and I wasn’t really able to say much. My co-workers pick up on it. I chalk it up to a lower energy day and try to move past the fog in my brain. Quotas may be missed...

[[&gt;]]
They all know.
[[/&gt;]]

[[=]]
I move. I breathe. I close my eyes. I keep working.
[[/=]]

A scream came from me, twisting my insides and scraping my throat. It terrified those around me as all I got were distant stares. I feel sick, bile rising in my throat. I shove it off, trying to finish anything today. Voices nip at my mind, gnawing at it and trying to break it. 

I wasn’t where I thought I was. I’m not here. Site-37 never existed. Nothing existed. Time is being taken from me. It was Friday, now it’s Thursday. I need to get out of here. I need to save everyone. I need to fix everything.

[[=]]
I get up. I run. I claw. I scrape. 
[[/=]]

Not good enough. 

[[&gt;]]
Not good enough.
[[/&gt;]]

Not good enough. 

[[&gt;]]
Not good enough. Not good enough. Not good enough. Not good enough. Not good enough.
[[/&gt;]]

Not good enough. Not good enough. Not good enough. Not good enough. Not good enough.

[[=]]
I push. I pull. I grab. I bleed.
[[/=]]

[[&gt;]]
Help me.
[[/&gt;]]


This isn’t me. This isn’t who I am. I’m in a trap. I’m stuck. I’m not controlling me. This is someone else. 

[[&gt;]]
I’m you.
[[/&gt;]]

[[=]]
I rip. I grab. I tear. I scream.
[[/=]]

No. No. No. 

None of this is me. You aren’t  me. You wish you were me. You’re not. You’re not. Leave me alone.

[[&gt;]]
Trust me.
[[/&gt;]]

I push against the wall. I claw at it. I need to break it. Hurt it.

Break down this body. 
Take what’s mine. 
I rip at it. Pull it apart. 
I need it. 
They waste. 
It’s mine. It’s rightfully mine. 
I’m you. 
We’re one and the same. 
Stop fighting. It’s over soon. 
I promise it hurts less. 
Trust me.
You’ll be free.
