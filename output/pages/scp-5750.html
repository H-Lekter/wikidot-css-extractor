**Special Containment Procedures** SCP-5750 is currently uncontained, and cannot be contained. Web crawlers have been instated to flag any complaints about SCP-5750, as this may leave evidence of its existence. As of 3/18/19, over 121 complaints have been flagged, all discredited and censored. Regardless of SCP-5750&#39;s un-containable properties, plans to protect normalcy have been maintained.

**Description:** 
SCP-5750 is the collective designation for multiple words that hold memetic properties when used together in a sentence. This effect causes an individual to seek out and buy products from GoI-1912 (&#34;Girl Scouts&#34;). The effect lasts until the subject has spent at least $10 (USD) buying one of their products, or SCP-5750-2. Members of GoI-1912, now designated SCP-5750-1, have been shown to be completely immune to SCP-5750. SCP-5750-1 instances have been shown to have no recollection of the effect or their immunity of SCP-5750. SCP-5750-1 instances tend to be door to door sellers of SCP-5750-2, also known as &#34;Girl Scout Cookies.&#34; Juliette Gordon Low, (the founder of GoI-1912,) has been designated PoI-1912. The Foundation has failed to capture PoI-1912, as all attempts close to success have ended in triggering the effect of SCP-5750. Further attempts have been set to low priority.

**Discovery:** SCP-5750 was discovered on 06/05/19 when Junior Researcher Craig Clark reported that the words may have had anomalous properties. He stated the number of social media posts complaining about GoI-1912&#39;s sales tactics had increased. This increase directly correlates with the exponential growth of GoI-1912 since first discovered. Evidence of an anomaly was further backed up by counter-memetic filtering of the posts.

**Notes:** SCP-5750-2 instances sold by SCP-5750-1 have no anomalous properties and are chemically similar to other brands of similarly flavored cookies. SCP-5750 is the only anomaly when it comes to the cookies, as combining the words //(do not repeat)// &#34;Wanna buy girl scout cookies?&#34; together in a spoken sentence triggers its effect. SCP-5750-1 instances only appear to target those with spending power high enough to afford their products. 



**Addendum-SCP-5750.1:** On 03/11/2019, Foundation web crawlers picked up a string of tweets from a user going by the handle @ImMonster539. The individual was brought into custody, amnesticized, and returned to his home. The tweets have been removed; however, personnel captured a screenshot before censoring it. The image is attached here:

**Addendum-SCP-5750.2:** On 03/07/2019, an incident was reported by Site Director Klaid Chandler. A note ended up in the mailbox of Chandler addressed to the Foundation. A transcription is attached below:

&gt; It has come to the Girl Scout&#39;s attention that you are trying to facilitate capture of our leader.
&gt; 
&gt; We would like to request you to stop.
&gt; 
&gt; This is for your own good, as Juliette always said: &#34;**##darkred|Peace until War.##**&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; If you continue these attempts, it&#39;ll be more than war.

On top of this Chandler also received an email in which he responded to, both are held below:

&gt; Hey, friend!
&gt; 
&gt; Just in-case the previous message gets lost in transit!~
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Your continued attempts at our leader will not stand. You don&#39;t want a war with us. We have a lot more than just cookies. I recommend you back down.

&gt; 
&gt; Hello Carla.
&gt; 
&gt; This in regards to your previous email. We will not be backing down. I speak for the whole Foundation when I say: You will lose. I promise you.
&gt; 
&gt; Your leader is the lowest priority we have. Besides:
&gt; 
&gt; We won&#39;t make a deal with a shady ##darkgrey|businesswoman##.
&gt; 
&gt; Buckle up, ##darkred|Scumbag##.
