+++ My Lover, the Dog - Part one

I’d always heard about Kain Pathos Crow, but I’d neve understood what he really was.  He was a  dog, but like that, so much a man.

We were alone, I his new lab asisstant, supposed to be an extra set of hands, or paws.

&#34;Could you hand me that?&#34;he asked.  I caught mystelf watching him, intent on his physicue.  How could he talk, or do anything? He moved like a dancer. &#34;What?&#34;

&#34;Nevermind&#34;  he said, jumping upp to the table to grab his beakers..  Hed had installed a set of stools, to reach up.

&#34;Dr. Crow? I asked, but he stopped me.

&#34;I dont want to talk about my disability.&#34; &#34;It’’s hard enough tp be the  laughing stock of the Fundation, I dont want to be that in my own office!&#34;  He scared me, but I saw his pain.

Please Mr. Crow&#34;,  I said, &#34;I know that your hurting.  I just want to be abel to help!&#34;

&#34;No!&#34; He Barked at me, throwing his test tubes to the ground.

&#34;Every day oits the same things! What would you  know about how I feel/?!&#34; Because he was standing at eye-to-eye level with me, for the first time I could really look at him.  I saw his humanity,..

and I felt like I wanted him.

His expresion melted, and I could see tears well in his dog face.  &#34;Mr. Crow,  did you ever havbe a wife?&#34;  I asked

&#34;I did&#34;  he said &#34;but she never knew what happened to me, or about that I became a dog.  She would hate because I did this to myself.&#34;

&#34;Dr. Crow, I dont hate you.&#34;  I said ,and kissed him.

It lasted a long time, and soon we were on the ground, kissing passionately.  I slowly reached down his underside, and saw his tail wagg.  It was so worng, but so right.  We made love there.
