**Special Containment Procedures:** No longer required. 

**Description:** SCP-5515 was a male human of Sudanese nationality with cognitohazardous properties. Anyone who made visual contact with SCP-5515 would anomalously gain awareness of the fact that SCP-5515 possessed a vitally important secret known to no other living person.

Those affected by SCP-5515 also experienced occasional intrusive thoughts about possible means of extracting this information from SCP-5515. These thoughts were often violent in nature, but did not compel an affected subject to carry out the action. Attempts to nonviolently ascertain the information possessed by SCP-5515 or determine its possible relevance to the Foundation and its goals were unsuccessful. 

Personnel involved in containment of SCP-5515 reported mental fatigue and negative emotional states as a result of intrusive thoughts. Those dealing with such issues were encouraged to write down the thoughts that bothered them as a cognitive therapy exercise and research opportunity. Examples of submissions are given below:

On 13/03/2020, SCP-5515 confessed to Foundation personnel that he was a closeted homosexual. Special concessions were made to allow SCP-5515 to come out publicly via social media, after which all anomalous activity ceased. SCP-5515 was pronounced neutralized, administered selective amnestics, and later emigrated to Canada with the aid of Foundation resources.

The origins of SCP-5515&#39;s anomalous properties remain unknown. SCP-5515 has claimed to have full knowledge of how the phenomenon began, what party was responsible, and what that party plans to do next. SCP-5515 readily offered this information to the Foundation at several junctures; however, no testimony was ever documented due to a lack of interest among presiding staff.
