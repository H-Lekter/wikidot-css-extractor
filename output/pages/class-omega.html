I saw the doctors again yesterday.  They told me to write down anything interesting I remember, and anything weird that happens to me. Give it to them the next time they see me. Said it would help them know how my recovery is going.  That&#39;s the problem, I can&#39;t remember much of anything.  They told me I was in the Army for 22 years, until my transport got blown up by an IED. Lucky to be alive, they say.  Maybe so, but I hit my head so hard I don&#39;t remember a day of it, except in little bits every so often.  It&#39;s funny, when I remember those little bits, I don&#39;t think it was the Army, even though I remember carrying a gun.  I don&#39;t know what it was though.  One day, I was in a comic book store, I like the comics, they&#39;re easy to read and the pictures help you figure out what&#39;s going on.  There was a comic called &#34;Weird Science Fantasy&#34; and I was reading a little bit in the store. All of a sudden, I looked at the thing in the comic and said &#34;SCP-1841! We contained that last year!&#34; I got all excited, and the guy in the shop wanted to know what the hell I was talking about.  I tried to explain, but must not have done a good job, because he thought I was a nut for thinking the things in comic books are real.  He asked me what an &#34;SCP&#34; is supposed to be, and I didn&#39;t know, it just jumped in my head, that&#39;s how those bits of memory work. He just thinks I&#39;m weird and stupid but didn&#39;t throw me out because I buy lots of comics.

I don&#39;t catch things out of the comic book anymore.  If I ever did, I&#39;m not really sure.  Now I&#39;m a Security Guard at this big warehouse.  They got me a job there when I got out of the hospital.  Southwestern Cryptobiotic Products! I can spell that because it&#39;s on the flyers I give out.  If someone comes in and they don&#39;t have a key card, I&#39;m supposed to give them one of those, tell them &#34;We&#39;re not open to the public yet&#34; and get them to leave.  It&#39;s a funny place, they don&#39;t even give me a key card and I&#39;ve never been in the back to see what they do.  Something to keep food from spoiling for a long time, that&#39;s what the flyers say.  I don&#39;t know why it has to be such a big secret.

I used to carry a gun, now I ride the bus.  The bus is full of weird people these days.  A person can bring any damn thing on a bus.  Some guy got on at 15th street this morning with a thing in an old broken baby carriage.  I don&#39;t know what it was, it had a big plastic trash bag on it covering it up.  It didn&#39;t fit right, the thing was poking at it in all kinds of strange angles.  He wheeled it right up next to me and I tensed up and thought &#34;Jesus Christ, that thing might be Keter!&#34; Keter? What does Keter even mean? Something you shouldn&#39;t be allowed to bring on the bus, I guess.  A couple times I thought the thing moved, and I reached for the gun I don&#39;t have any more.  Last year, I would have known what to do about that thing.  Now I don&#39;t, and the guy and his thing got off at 36th St.  I shouldn&#39;t have to know, they should train the bus driver to know what to do when something Keter gets on her bus.
