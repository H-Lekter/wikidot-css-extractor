Dr. Lee Roy Carlson is a biological researcher currently stationed at Site-77.  His family calls him Leroy, his friends call him Elroy (L. Roy), his acquaintances call him Lee, Nobody calls him Roy, his enemies call him Carl, and his parents call him Son.  His hot girlfriend[[footnote]]You wouldn&#39;t know her, she works in the antimemetics division.[[/footnote]] calls him &#34;baby&#34;, and she&#39;s the only one allowed to do that.  He can be easily spotted by the red-and-blue floral-patterned bucket hat he wears whenever there&#39;s no one higher-ranking than him nearby, even though it&#39;s against the dress code.  He owns a Scarlet macaw tastelessly named &#34;King&#34; (Get it?  He&#39;s King the Scarlet!  Wait, come back!), plays tenor saxophone, and [[[scp-1459-extended-testing-log |slaughters puppies]]] in a distressingly casual manner, but claims it&#39;s all in the name of science.  Dr. Carlson&#39;s proudest achievement is the time he won a Foundation star for killing [[[SCP-682]]].  His greatest shame is the time his Foundation star was revoked when SCP-682 [[[experiment-log-t-98816-oc108-682 |turned out not to be dead]]].

Dr. Carlson is not, nor has he ever been, affiliated with the Shark Punching Center in any way, shape, or form.  He will continue saying it until you believe him.  No one has ever once seen him punching a shark, and even if they did what of it?  Lots of people hate sharks!  They&#39;re dangerous and scary!  Stop looking at him like that!  He loves it here at the SPC!

No, please, he meant to say SCP, he swears!  It&#39;s an easy mistake to make!  Don&#39;t...

//Dr. Carlson is currently unavailable.  Please leave a message after the cognitohazard.//

* [[[Halloween on 17th Street]]] - my first contribution to the site, something that I had forgotten until relatively recently.  I remain surprised that a holiday tale about Clef and a bunch of Series I SCPs is one of my three highest-rated works.
* [[[SCP-4225]]] - the first SCP I attempted, and the first that succeeded.  I thought it would be best to start with something simple, a nice Safe-class anomaly with a lot of cute and very little story.  Once again, I&#39;m surprised that it worked so well.
* [[[SCP-4314]]] - my lowest-rated SCP, currently.  The idea was very disjointed originally, but I made a series of frantic edits to rescue it from deletion and wound up with this stagnant-rated hunk of junk instead.  I remain unsatisfied with this one, and still intend to rewrite it one of these days with the help of somebody who understands math better.
* [[[SCP-4820]]] - my highest-rated article.  Like 4314, it started with some disjointed crap in there, but I edited it out to make something that I&#39;m now quite proud of.  I&#39;m still not 100% satisfied with the last log - I could&#39;ve ended it at the recovered items, or maybe the teeth, but that just seemed too abrupt.  One day I might go back and change that interview so that, instead of half-assed Sarkic implications, his philosophy is more like that of [[[SCP-3240 | the Veldt]]].  That&#39;s probably what I would&#39;ve done to begin with if I had been aware of the Veldt&#39;s existence at the time.
* [[[the-drooling-path-part-1 | The Drooling Path]]] - this is my most ambitious project, an ongoing (currently three-part) series featuring [[[SCP-058]]], [[[SCP-1981]]], [[[SCP-2432]]], and some other SCPs yet-to-be-disclosed.  As you might&#39;ve guessed if you&#39;re familiar with those three, this series is mostly about word salad:  the creepy, nonsensical gibberish that these anomalies use to paint abstract, surreal, and disturbing images on the backs of our brains.  Still pretty low-rated across the board, but the series has some fans, including [[*user LORDSTONEFISH]] (2432&#39;s author), which makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside.
* [[[SCP-039 Rewrite]]] - I don&#39;t want to talk about this one, except to say that if I had the chance to become a 039-A instance I don&#39;t think I&#39;d hesitate.  Jake&#39;s interview is rooted in my own personal frustrations with having to constantly set aside and time and money in my schedule and budget to perform unpleasant but necessary biological functions.
* [[[You Are At The Center of Everything That Happens To You]]] - 3999 is my favorite article, so this was probably inevitable.  Dropped as low as -3, but looks like it&#39;s gonna live, somehow.  There will be more to the story of Talloran and Nines.
