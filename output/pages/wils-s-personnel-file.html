Hi %%title%%,
[[/module]]
Sorry that this is somewhat spartan in both style and content.  Come back in about a year and there&#39;ll be different colours, and fonts, maybe a picture or two.  I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m just blue sky thinking here. 

To be honest, I would&#39;ve preferred a few more decent scips under my belt before creating this page, but I&#39;m doing it more to have &#34;everything under one roof&#34;, so to speak.


**Tales and SCiPs and That:**
[REDACTED]

++ What Critics Are Saying About Wils&#39; articles:

//&#34;SCP-2983 was the most best skip article ever, and I&#39;ve read all of &#39;em, even the crap ones.&#34;//  -  Ringo Starr, drummer with The Beatles.

//&#34;This article (SCP-2982) made me physically take in information via my eyes and process that information using my brain!&#34;// - John Steinbeck, American author.

//&#34;I literally couldn&#39;t put the book down once I&#39;d started reading the horrific tale &#34;Golan.&#34;  I really felt for the guy, even though he IS only a Glass Dee, whatever that is.  I&#39;ve been paid to say this.&#34;// - US President B Obama.

//&#34;I loved that one with the Russian guy who turns out to be [REDACTED] and he&#39;s got that [REDACTED] secreted in his stomach, and then he turns that researcher into an elephant. But the idiots who vote thought it was too confused, too unclear what was going on  and it was self-deleted. Idiots.&#34;// - Beyonce, US singer.

//&#34;I need the toilet.&#34;// - Pascal Michan, French philosopher.

//&#34;Wils writes stuff that makes our stuff look utter balls.&#34;// - Ron R Hubbard and Stephen King.   

//&#34;At The Libary has only been on the site for half a day, but it&#39;s already got a rating of +1 - that&#39;s science I can understand!&#34;// - Steven Hawking, professor of things.

From the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/log-of-extranormal-events Log of Extranormal Events]:

**Event Description:** Over an eight minute period, six hundred and ninety seven lightning strikes occurred within a twenty mile wide radius around Faeto, Italy. Meteorological data shows that the locations of these strikes formed a &#34;smiley.&#34; At the same time, all drinking water within the settlement was, according to anecdotal evidence, icy cold, scented of strawberries, and could not be boiled or otherwise heated.
**Date of occurrence:** 2015/07/01
**Location:** Faeto, Italy
**Follow-up actions taken:** Water supplies and meteorological data throughout Puglia to be monitored over a six month period.


**Event Description:** Commencing at 07:31, all instances of the Basenji breed of Canis lupus familiaris barked constantly for one minute and forty three seconds. Commencement/cessation of barking was not linked to any external stimuli.
**Date of occurrence:** 2015/07/03
**Location:** Australia
**Follow-up actions taken:** Fallopia, Agent [REDACTED]&#39;s Basenji, taken for post-anomaly testing. No anomalous activity noted since.

Just some stuff that I&#39;m working on.  Seriously if I could just focus on one at a time I&#39;d churn these out once a day. As it is, it&#39;s four a year. Maybe.

I&#39;ve written a couple of very short pieces on www.Fanfiction.net in the Hellraiser universe -

[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11063653/1/There-Are-No-Limits There Are No Limits] about a misguided criminal beginning to regret summoning demons from hell in his bathroom.
