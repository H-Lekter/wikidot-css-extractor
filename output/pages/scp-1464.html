**Item #:** SCP-1464

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Except for approved experimentation, it is forbidden to observe SCP-1464 under natural lighting during the time period between sunset and nautical twilight, and during the time period between nautical dawn and sunrise; any research into the properties and contents of SCP-1464 during these time periods must be conducted under 1000-watt lamps providing full-spectrum illumination. The thirty-five (35) square kilometers surrounding SCP-1464 have been purchased by the Foundation via a front company, and serve as an interdiction zone. Civilians are to be dissuaded with a cover story of limnological research.

The airspace above the interdiction zone surrounding SCP-1464 is restricted. Satellite imagery of the interdiction zone is to be intercepted and modified so that direct images of SCP-1464 do not become public.

**Description:** SCP-1464 is a body of water in the forests of northern [REDACTED], approximately 82 hectares in size. When viewed under lighting conditions corresponding to dawn or twilight, SCP-1464 is a cognitohazard. Affected subjects experience highly detailed false memories of having participated in ritual crimes at the site of SCP-1464 at some point in the past; all affected subjects express intense remorse and guilt at having participated (regardless of whether this is compatible with their psychological profiles), describe the ritual as having concluded with a victim or victims being submerged within SCP-1464, claim that the ritual was necessary in order to prevent what is effectively an XK-class end-of-the-world scenario, and state that the ritual was incorrectly performed and must be repeated. 

The precise nature of the ritual described by affected subjects varies depending on a number of parameters, including but not limited to the density of foliage on surrounding trees, the presence of floating debris, and &gt;1m modifications to SCP-1464&#39;s coastline (see document 1464-T17 for a full list of known parameters). Since coming to the attention of the Foundation, the parameters regulating SCP-1464&#39;s anomalous effect have undergone natural changes sufficient to result in a new configuration 85 times; as well, new configurations have resulted from deliberate experimentation 25 times, and from accidental modification 3 times.

All subjects exposed to SCP-1464 under a given configuration describe the same ritual; as well, subjects share an anomalous awareness of each other&#39;s existence, such that if three separate subjects are exposed to a given configuration, and then interrogated separately, they will all report that the ritual involved three participants, and will be able to corroborate each other&#39;s stories. Details of the ritual range from the plausible (the slaughter of nine nine-year-old children, at 9:09 AM, on the ninth day of the ninth month, 1999) to the nonsensical (the rape and strangulation of a green 1978 Volkswagen Beetle, on the fifty-sixth day of June, 1974); at no time has any subject expressed cognitive dissonance, regardless of how incompatible the described scenario is with reality.

Underwater exploration and sonar analysis of SCP-1464 have not revealed any of the submerged objects described by affected subjects, nor do missing-persons reports and reports of livestock theft correspond to any of the rituals described; however, in approximately 30% of cases, the scenarios which the rituals are allegedly intended to prevent correspond to worst-case extrapolations involving known SCPs.

Samples of water and aquatic biota from SCP-1464 have not been found to be anomalous.
