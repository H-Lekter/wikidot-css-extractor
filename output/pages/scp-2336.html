**Item #:** SCP-2336

**Object Class:** --Euclid-- Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** The Foundation maintains a network of observation satellites to monitor and report the emergence of any Howard-Stross gateways that are formed other than through normal Foundation activities.  If such a gateway is formed, Mobile Task Force Tau-16 is to be dispatched.  Consult document 2336-N for details of engagement protocol for the Type I and Type II entities that typically arrive through such a gateway.

//Note: See supplemental containment procedures in Addendum 1 below.//

**Description:**  SCP-2336 is a sequence of phonemes, not known to correspond to any meaning in any living or known extinct language.  Document 2336-A contains a representation of SCP-2336 in the International Phonetic Alphabet.

The vocal articulation of this phoneme sequence by a human subject has been experimentally demonstrated to result in the formation of a Howard-Stross gateway[[footnote]] Binsfeld, Peter, “Invocation of Topological Transformations to Engineer One-Way Interdimensional Passageway”.   //Observer: An SCP Foundation Journal (2003)//: 18-C-23, 88-89.[[/footnote]] normally having a duration of 2 to 11 seconds.  The formation of such a gateway frequently results in the arrival of a Type I or Type II tartarean entity (designated an instance of SCP-2336-A).  

Although instances of SCP-2336-A are frequently hostile, [[[spikebrennan&#39;s proposal|through trial and error]]] the Foundation has developed a reliable protocol for containing them, communicating with them, documenting their characteristics, and (most recently) controlling them and applying their capabilities toward research purposes and other useful activities.[[footnote]] Requests for permission to apply SCP-2336 to summon an instance of SCP-2336-A for research purposes under controlled conditions are to be directed to the Evocation Department.[[/footnote]]  An excerpt of the containment and processing log for instances of SCP-2336-A follows:

||~ Designation ||~ Description ||~ Application || 
||SCP-2336-A1 ||Non-sapient hexapod, mass approx. 1800 kg.  Emits slime composed of high concentrations of sulfur and phosphorus. || Milked for chemical compounds for research and industrial use.|| 
||SCP-2336-A8 ||Non-sapient tetrapod with body plan superficially resembling a rhinoceros.  Mass approx. 1200 kg.  Body temperature in excess of 260 °C.  Breathes fire. || Powers turbine to supply electricity to Site 38.|| 
||SCP-2336-A72 ||Sapient.  Invisible (body plan assumed to be bipedal and winged).  Capable of communicating in classical Arabic.  During interviews, claims to be composed of &#34;smokeless flame of fire.&#34;  Capable of levitating. || Containment chamber integrated into elevator at Site 32 to economize energy use.||
||SCP-2336-A210 ||Sapient biped.  Reddish hide. || Used as gas filter in modified Maxwell engine to overcome thermodynamics.|| 
||SCP-2336-A322 ||Sapient biped.  Iridescent hide. || Consciousness imprinted into Laplace processor for computational purposes.||
||SCP-2336-A416 ||Semi-sapient with irregular body plan.  Capable of summoning an apparently unlimited supply of live, non-anomalous //Musca domestica// from unknown source. || Flies crushed and processed for use as fertilizer and for other industrial purposes.||
||SCP-2336-A666 ||Sapient biped.  Interviews indicate that SCP-2336-A666 occupies a position of authority in the society accessed by means of the gateway. || After negotiation, exchanged for recovery of personnel who had been lost during a containment breach of [[[SCP-1844]]].||

**Addendum 1:**  Further research indicates that under certain conditions, a vocal articulation of SCP-2336 is likely to result in a much larger Howard-Stross gateway, thereby presenting a risk that a much larger tartarean entity (possibly one or more Type VIII entities) could manifest.  Analysis indicates that three exacerbating factors are:

* Proximity of the human subject to (██.████° N,  ███.████° E) at the time that SCP-2336 is articulated (that location is designated as Location K)
* Whether the human subject is a member of Y-chromosomal haplogroup ███-██.
* Astronomical conditions specified in Appendix 2336-S.

The manifestation of even one Type VIII entity would presumably constitute a Category 7 (XK) eschatologic condition.  To mitigate risk, supplemental containment procedures have been adopted in order to lessen the risk that SCP-2336 could be articulated under conditions when one or more of the risk factors are present.

# Access to Location K has been restricted by placing a landfill at the site.
# The Foundation has developed a teratogen and introduced it to the water supply in the geographic area where most of the population of haplogroup ███-██ resides, for the purpose of causing individuals born in that area to have congenital anatomical defects which render them physically unable to vocalize the phonemes.
# Proposals to address astronomical conditions are under consideration.
