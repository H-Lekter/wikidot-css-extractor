**Item #:** SCP-007-J

**Object Class:** Euclid, awaiting advancement to Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** The whereabouts of SCP-007-J are currently unknown, although it has been confirmed that it has not left Site ████ since its initial discovery in Officer Blake and Officer Evan&#39;s office. Recon Team Theta is awaiting authorisation to sweep the premises. In the mean time, all staff are advised not to engage SCP-007-J due to its unknown nature.

**Description:** SCP-007-J is a blueberry muffin which belonged to Foundation Officer Evan, prior to the discovery of its anomalous nature and its subsequent designation as an SCP.

SCP-007-J was identified during Officers Blake and Evan&#39;s assigned lunch hour on ██/██/████. The anomaly occurred during a phone call Officer Evan received, which required him to leave the room. Whilst unobserved by Officer Blake, SCP-007-J, which Officer Evan had left unattended on his desk (planning to consume it after his phone call, believing it to be an ordinary muffin), disappeared by unknown means, leaving only a residue of unknown properties on Officer Blake&#39;s lips.

The transcript of the exchange which led to SCP-007-J&#39;s discovery is recorded below.

&gt; **Officer Evan:** (Entering the door, having concluded his phone call.) “Hey man... Oh... dude, where the hell is my muffin?”
&gt; 
&gt; **Officer Blake:** “What?”
&gt; 
&gt; **Officer Evan:** “No! We have been over the ethics of food stealing! You do not steal another man&#39;s pastries!”
&gt; 
&gt; **Officer Blake:** “I swear to god I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.”
&gt; 
&gt; **Officer Evan:** “So my muffin just walked out of here on its own, did it?”
&gt; 
&gt; **Officer Blake:** “Well... I don&#39;t know... Stranger things have happened! I mean, you can believe in a concrete Weeping Angel or an indestructible, homicidal crocodile, but not a sentient muffin? Wait... do you think that&#39;s what we&#39;re dealing with here?”
&gt; 
&gt; **Officer Evan:** “No, I think you&#39;ve eaten it. You&#39;ve still got crumbs on your face, for fuck&#39;s sake!”
&gt; 
&gt; **Officer Blake:** (Grasping mouth area in panic.) “Oh shit! It&#39;s left its residue on me! Grab me an SCP form, I&#39;m gonna run to the med bay and get myself checked out!”
&gt; 
&gt; **Officer Evan:** “You&#39;re an idiot.”
&gt;

The residue left on Officer Blake&#39;s lips was identified as crumbs from SCP-007-J. It is currently unknown how or why SCP-007-J left its mark upon Officer Blake, but medical analysis has revealed no long term effects. As a precaution, Officer Blake is to spend three (3) days in quarantine. 

Additionally, to prevent other on-site pastries from animating as a result of exposure to SCP-007-J, or the Foundation itself (as may be SCP-007-J&#39;s origin) the cafeteria is to be kept under armed guard until SCP-007-J is secured.</textarea></pre>
