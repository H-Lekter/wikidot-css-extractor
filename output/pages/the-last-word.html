//In the autumn months, if you walk along the Site-19 grounds and you see an old rusted fence, you might want to see what&#39;s on the other side. Over there, the leaves will all crunch underfoot as you walk through the grass. It would seem to be just like any other part of the grounds. But look at the ground. Those stones are the tombs where many fallen men and women lie. D-Class, Researcher, Agent...they&#39;re all equal here. So pay a visit to the Site-19 boneyard. Read some tombstones. Maybe even find some old friends.// 

...

//Margaret couldn&#39;t help but feel a small twinge of satisfaction as her saw sliced the last sinews of muscle, ridding her of the ugly fake leg some person had swapped for her real leg. Said real leg was lying on the table in front of her, glistening with ebony perfection. The skin was flawless, and the ankle looked like it was young and rich with calcium. The fake one had been gnarled by skin cancer, hideous moles, and wrinkled skin. But as she re-affixed her leg to her hip, she knew that her long foot pain nightmare was over.//

&gt; Margaret Daniels - She always said that her feet were killing her.

//Dr. Vang waited impatiently by the elevator doors, key card in hand. He had some important tests to run, and he wasn&#39;t going to be held up by some creaky old equipment that couldn&#39;t open the doors on time. After what seemed like seasons, the doors opened. But where was the elevator? Grumbling about how these things don&#39;t work the way they used to, Vang stuck his head into the shaft to look around.//

&gt; Looked up the elevator shaft to see if the car was on the way down - It was.

//Agent Ekblad checked his watch. 15 minutes, and still no sign of anomalous atmospheric conditions. The commander was going to want results from tonight&#39;s tests - they would be necessary for seizing it away from the Foundation. Juggling a connection to the Insurgency while working on a high level testing facility hadn&#39;t been easy, but when he was able to escape with the Insurgents after the gator was captured, it&#39;d all be worth it.//

&gt; The head of a traitor, eaten by an alligator - Hope to find the body later.

//Paul felt a spike of pain shoot up his leg. These damned &#34;heels&#34; were excruciating. It would&#39;ve been at least bearable if the skin and muscle hadn&#39;t been cut away, but Mr. Marshall had decided to do an &#34;experiment&#34;. God, his bones were bending. He needed to sit. Get down. the pain in his ankle was beginning to break him he could feel it cracking and it hurt and it hurt and snap. He tumbled forward on broken, useless legs.//

&gt; Here lies Paul: he was tall, he had a fall, and that was all.

//Dmitri felt a bitter cold at the edges of his nostrils. The climb had been arduous, but soon he would be the youngest man to conquer Everest alone. The thoughts of fame and fortune could wait: he needed to actually reach the peak. As he dug his pick into a rock, he heard something. Who was that? How had he gotten up here...//

&gt; His foot did slip and he did fall.
&gt; Help! He cried.
&gt; And that was all.
