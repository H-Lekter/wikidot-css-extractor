------

**History:** Dr. P██████ Gibbons worked for the Scientific Police of the █████████ Republic as a Medical Examiner until involved with incident ████-██ (related to SCP-███, see document [DATA EXPUNGED] for more information regarding [DATA EXPUNGED]). In the light of the heavy loss of personnel in Site 19 after said incident ████-██, plus the loss of medical and on-site retrieval personnel during incident ███-24-██████-A, O5 directive found a valuable Foundation asset in Gibbons and opted to hire him as a low-level Foundation researcher instead of the usual administration of a class A amnesiac. Dr. Gibbons is currently working as a multi-purpose, Medical-wing oriented researcher until the issue on lack of personnel stabilizes.

**Personal Information:**

* Proved dexterity with weaponry handling stemming from his time as a Police force member.
* Poor eyesight.


**Psychological Profile by On-site Psychiatrist [DATA EXPUNGED]:** 
* Generally sociable.
* Has shown symptoms of high-functioning Tourette&#39;s Syndrome - diagnosis pending. 
* Fascinated with the Internet, and the societies that formed around the Internet (Mostly, the history of websites such as █████ and people surrounding them) //Good, another one of those, that&#39;s JUST the thing we need. -O5-█//
* Has a noticeable speech difficulty stemming from English not being his first language and a tendency to speak too quickly.
* Interests include: Sharpshooting, writing, reading, and &#34;a metric fuckton of other stuff.&#34;

**Addendum**

__Addendum Gibbons-B__: 
//Will now dedicate all available time to brewing a coffee properly. If somebody like Clef ever gets to taste that colored water somebody will go on a killing spree. -O5-█//

**Note:** //Dr. Gibbons is not Dr. Bright. Dr. Bright is a gibbon. Dr. Gibbons does not need to display [[[SCP-963]]] at all times, and should not be treated with hostility if he does not display it. Please keep this in mind for future interactions.// -O5-6</textarea></pre>
