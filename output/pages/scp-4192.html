**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4192 is to be kept inside a QED (Quantum Electrodynamic) Vacuum Chamber[[footnote]]A vacuum chamber in which the quantum state of all energy existing within is at its lowest possible state as Zero-point energy. QED Vacuum Chambers are useful in isolating and separating the elementary particles in matter or function as containment for anomalous phenomena that exist at a subatomic level.[[/footnote]], which is placed within a high-value, Safe-Class anomalous item locker. Testing with SCP-4192 should only be limited to research and with permission from Dr. Phoenix.

**Description:** SCP-4192 refers to the nucleus of a single Hydrogen atom that emits radio waves at random intervals. Extensive analysis on SCP-4192 has shown that despite its abnormal nature, it behaves and functions properly as any nucleon or hadron would; having a positive electric charge, an elementary charge, and possessing a mass less than that of a neutron.

Research on SCP-4192&#39;s makeup has been inconclusive as SCP-4192 does not appear to be composed of quarks but of something else entirely. Analysis of the radio waves generated by SCP-4192 have been recorded at 15 to 18 MHz in the form of Cosmic background noise.

**Addendum 4192.1:** Experimentation

Due to the sensitive nature of SCP-4192, the Artificial Intelligent Conscript, Goliath.aic, was created specifically to handle equipment and containment as well as perform experiments pertaining to SCP-4192.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Access Addendum&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]
On 01/04/21, an experiment was conducted to ascertain the physical properties of SCP-4192 headed by Dr. Tardtakovsky under the supervision of Dr. Phoenix. Prior to testing, a hypodermic needle was refined by [[[SCP-914|SCP-914]]] and attached to a robotic arm apparatus in order to interact with SCP-4192.

During the experiment, Goliath.aic detected repulsion emanating from the atom as it breached the atomic orbital[[footnote]]Informally known as the electron cloud, the atomic orbital is an area around the atomic nucleus where the electron is capable of existing at any given moment within the area simultaneously. This principle is often associated with acts of quantum superposition or quantum uncertainty.[[/footnote]] of SCP-4192, claiming that the repulsion was similar to that of magnets repelling each other. Despite this observation, Goliath.aic was ordered to continue with the test and push the needle further into the atom.

The experiment was immediately interrupted by an Omega One Alert from Foundation satellites, which reported an extremely large celestial object approaching the planet. Imaging from the satellite feed depicted a tubular metal rod with a projected collision directed towards the North American continent that was expected to strike Philadelphia; the current location of Site-98. Goliath.aic immediately withdrew the needle apparatus from SCP-4192, effectuating the large object to immediately reverse in its direction until it could no longer be detected by the satellites.

Following this, all testing with SCP-4192 is currently forbidden. There are currently no plans to be made of SCP-4192&#39;s research.
