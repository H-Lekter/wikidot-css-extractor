**Special Containment Procedures**
SCP-6036 should be kept in a 150 gallon freshwater tank, in Site-24-A. SCP-6036&#39;s tank should be stocked with several other species of cichlids from Lake Tanganyika. SCP-6036 is to be provided with any requested amenities upon approval by at least two level 2 personnel. SCP-6036&#39;s armor and sword are to be held in a drawer beneath its tank.

SCP-6036 is to be transported to Lake Tanganyika monthly. Once arrived, SCP-6036 is to be fitted with a tracking device and be allowed to freely roam the lake for three days. Once the three day period is over, SCP-6036 is to be retrieved and brought back to Site-24-A.

**Description**
SCP-6036 appears to be a member of the species //Neolamprologus tretocephalus//[[footnote]]Five-bar Cichlid[[/footnote]], measuring 16cm in length. SCP-6036 is sapient and is capable of telepathic communication with any human being within an approximately 6 meter radius. SCP-6036 has the ability to grab objects with its pectoral fins and often uses this ability to rearrange its tank to its liking. SCP-6036 also possesses an abnormally high amount of strength, being able to lift small metal objects with relative ease.

SCP-6036 possesses a set of steel armor, modified to fit its body. The armor consists of a helmet and a chest plate, which wraps the majority of its abdomen. SCP-6036 also possesses a small steel sword, with a modified handle which allows SCP-6036 to easily grasp it.

**Addendum 6036.1:** Initial Recovery
SCP-6036 was discovered on 7/4/2021 off the coast of Kigoma in Lake Tanganyika after reports of a &#34;fish swordfighting a crocodile&#34; began coming in. Foundation agents quickly responded and discovered SCP-6036 beached on the shore, struggling to breathe. SCP-6036 was quickly submerged in a tank and made a quick recovery over the course of the next week. Following SCP-6036&#39;s recovery, an interview was conducted with it and is transcribed below.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Access Interview Log 6036-1&#34; hide=&#34;- ACCESS GRANTED&#34;]]
&gt; = **INTERVIEW LOG**
&gt; **Date:** 7/11/2021
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Munn
&gt; **Interviewee:** SCP-6036
&gt; ------
&gt; **[BEGIN LOG]**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Munn:** Good morning, SCP-6036.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6036:** Please, call me Zuberi, Knight of Tanganyika.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr: Munn:** SCP-6036 will do. How are you feeling today?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6036:** Much better. However this tank... lacks culture, emotion. An empty home is not one fit for a knight.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Munn:** Once you&#39;ve fully recovered, we will move you into a permanent tank, which I&#39;m sure will be to your liking.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6036:** I see.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Munn:** I&#39;m here to conduct an interview if you don&#39;t mind. I&#39;ll be asking a few questions about you and your home.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6036:** Oh it&#39;s no problem at all, lady...
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Munn:** Munn.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6036:** Lady Munn, it&#39;s no problem at all.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Munn:** Excellent. Now, are you aware of your anomalous properties?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6036:** If you&#39;re referring to my ability to speak, then yes. All Knights of Tanganyika have been gifted with speech and are able to communicate with not just one another, but with you humans, as well.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Munn:** You keep referring to yourself as a knight, what do you mean by that?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6036:** You mean to tell me you&#39;ve never heard of the Knights of Tanganyika?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Munn:** I&#39;m afraid I haven&#39;t. Educate me.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6036:** My dear Munn, the Knights of Tanganyika are what keep the cichlids of our waters in balance! We protect our people from other fish, from crocodiles, from fishermen who wish to skin us and eat our flesh. We don&#39;t kill unless we have to, of course. We cut fishermen&#39;s lines and scare off crocodiles, all in respect of other living beings.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Munn:** And these knights, they&#39;re all fish?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6036:** Why of course! One for every 250 species of cichlid in the Lake. Without even one of the knights present, a species could go extinct. Which is why I need to return to my home.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Munn:** I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s not my call, but I doubt The Foundation would allow your release.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6036:** They must. I can not let my people die.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Munn:** As I said, that&#39;s not my call.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6036:** Lady Munn, I appreciate your dedication to your job, but you have to understand, I can&#39;t let my people die. They&#39;re my family, my friends. To you, they may just be fish but to me, they&#39;re more than that.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Munn:** SCP-6036 I understand that you want to return home, but it&#39;s not possible. Due to your anomalous properties, you have to be-
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6036:** I don&#39;t care about my &#34;anomalous properties&#34;, I need to return to the lake. My people need me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Munn:** You&#39;re people, you keep saying that. What do you mean?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6036:** My species! All my friends and family. Humans have those, right?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Munn:** Yes, we do-
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6036:** Then you must understand, I do not wish to see them die.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Munn:** I understand your concern, but you don&#39;t know that. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be just fine.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6036:** Lady Munn, are you a Knight of Tanganyika?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Munn:** No, I don&#39;t-
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6036:** Then you don&#39;t understand my concern. You have no idea what it would be like to be in my position. To feel how I&#39;m feeling.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Munn:** I understand that. But you need to calm down.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6036:** Calm down? I&#39;d say I am ridiculously calm for the situation you&#39;ve put me in. You&#39;ve taken me from my home and put me in a box, and now you&#39;re telling me I&#39;m not allowed to go back.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Munn:** You&#39;re not allowed to leave because of your anomalous properties. You-
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6036:** So what, I&#39;m different, so you put me in a box? Is that how you treat everything? Just because you don&#39;t understand something you decide to lock it up?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Munn:** As a matter of fact, that is how we treat everything.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6036:** Why? Have you ever considered the consequences? Do you ever consider that the people you decide to lock up have feelings? Families? You can&#39;t just take them away from their friends and family, that is cruel. Immoral. Evil, even. Doing that makes you no better than a kidnapper.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Munn:** We contain anomalies for the greater good of the Earth. If we didn&#39;t-
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6036:** By &#34;containing&#34; me, you&#39;re hurting my species. Hurting the Earth, which, according to you. is the opposite of what you&#39;re trying to accomplish here. Just please, let me leave. My people need me. I... I need them.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Munn:** I... guess that makes sense, but there&#39;s no proof that removing you from Tanganyika actually affects your species.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6036:** That&#39;s because it&#39;s only been a few days. If you pay attention, you&#39;ll see that they&#39;ll be dying, suffering. Because you couldn&#39;t handle keeping a fish out of a box.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Munn:** Until further proof is presented, I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll have to stay here.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6036:** Please Munn. I&#39;m begging you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Munn:** I&#39;m sorry.
&gt;

Following the Interview, a population watch of the //Neolamprologus tretocephalus// has been instated by the Foundation.

**Addendum 6036.2:** 8/20/2021 Update
Watches on the population of //Neolamprologus tretocephalus// have shown almost an instant decrease shortly following the containment of SCP-6036. Following the conclusion that SCP-6036 has a direct influence on the //Neolamprologus tretocephalus// population, Dr. Munn requested that a proposal be brought to SCP-6036, that being that SCP-6036 would be allowed to visit Lake Tanganyika monthly for three days and that it returns to Foundation custody afterward. This request was granted, and the following conversation is transcribed below.

&gt; **Date:** 8/21/2021
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Munn
&gt; **Interviewee:** SCP-6036
&gt; ------
&gt; **[BEGIN LOG]**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Munn:** Good morning, SCP-6036
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6036:** Good morning, Lady Munn.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Munn:** How have you been recently?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6036:** Lonely. These fish you accompany me with are much appreciated, but nonetheless, I miss my home.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Munn:** Then I think you&#39;ll be pleasantly surprised with the news I&#39;ve brought today
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6036:** Hm?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Munn:** The higher-ups have decided that you are to be allowed in Lake Tanganyika monthly, for three days at a time.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6036:** So, you finally noticed the population drop?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Munn:** Indeed. This is why I need to ask you if we let you into Tanganyika, will you return?
&gt; 
&gt; //(10 seconds of silence. SCP-6036 appears to be thinking)//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6036:** It&#39;s a deal, Lady Munn.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Munn:** Splendid. We&#39;ll be heading to Kigoma soon, so I suggest you prepare yourself.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6036:** I am always prepared. Oh, and Lady Munn?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Munn:** Yes?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6036:** Thank you.
&gt; 
&gt; **[END LOG]**
[[/collapsible]]

Following this log, Site-24-A was built in Kigoma for the sole purpose of containing SCP-6036. SCP-6036 was fit with a tracking device and brought to Kigoma and was promptly released into Tanganyika for a three day period, Following these three days, SCP-6036 willingly returned into Foundation custody.

**Addendum 6036.3:** 12/17/2021 Update
After approximately 4 monthly visits to Lake Tanganyika, the //Neolamprologus tretocephalus// population has gradually increased. It is expected to reach its previous numbers by 2/5/2022. SCP-6036 has been exponentially cooperative with each monthly release, going as far as to describe events that recently occurred with the so-called &#34;Knights of Tanganyika&#34;. Efforts to locate these &#34;Knights&#34; are ongoing, but have so far been unsuccessful.
