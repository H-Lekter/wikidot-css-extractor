[[span style=&#34;font-family: Baskerville Old Face;&#34;]] [[size 350%]]Fable[[/size]] [[/span]]

A fairly new face on staff that&#39;s managed to get their hands in a few projects. Since joining Foundation staff, Fable has been seen largely involving themself with items dealing with the paranormal, folklore, animals, and items with general low risk. Beyond that, they&#39;ve been active with helping other researchers develop their SCP and incident report articles. As a result they&#39;re easily found in site libraries, animal holding pens, and similar locations!

Seriously though, I typically specialize in SCPs that deal with ghosts, folktales, myths, or animals. A list of my SCP works is set up below, and hopefully one day Wikidot will be a functional site and actually show it.

[[span style=&#34;font-family: Baskerville Old Face;&#34;]] [[size 350%]]Personal Thoughts:[[/size]] [[/span]]

* [[[SCP-5372]]] &#34;My Gift to You, Oh Love&#34;: A simple story about a gay couple in the 50&#39;s and the cave that hid their love from the world. It&#39;s a short read, but one of my personal favorite works of mine.

* [[[SCP-5828]]] &#34;As in Life, So in Death&#34;: My most popular work on the wiki so far, as well as my first! Tells the story of an angry ghost and explores how media/popular perception of people can twist a narrative. Deals with themes of emotional manipulation, so be warned in advance. 

* [[[SCP-5829]]] &#34;The Prophet Hen of Boring&#34;: I&#39;ve always been a huge fan of Wilson&#39;s Wildlife Solutions, and I really wanted to write an article involving them. While not my strongest work on the site, I do think it&#39;s a nice, short story about a hen with a tough life.

* [[[SCP-5469]]] &#34;Winnie&#39;s Diner&#34;: I don&#39;t think I can say anything on this that wasn&#39;t already covered by my author&#39;s comment. My longest work yet and very character focused. This took a long time to write, and I think it is my best work here yet. 

* [[[SCP-6033]]] &#34;The Friend With Many Arms&#34;: A fun romp mixing some of my artwork with a wholesome story involving a boy and his monster. Currently my highest rated work, and I&#39;m beyond grateful for that.

* [[[SCP-6404]]] &#34;My Name is Your Name and Your Name is My Name&#34;: My first real &#34;horror&#34; article, and something WAY out of my normal style. I wasn&#39;t planning to hop on the shortform article trend, but I got hit with an idea that&#39;s perfect for it. If you like fridge horror, this one&#39;s for you.

Thanks for stopping by, and thanks for reading! Feel free to check me out on twitter **@fabledtiefling**</textarea></pre>
