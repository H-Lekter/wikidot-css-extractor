**Item #:** SCP-D0G3-J

[[include component:image-block name=D0G3.png|caption= An instance of SCP-D0G3-J]]

**Object Class:** --Euclid-- Much Keter. Such danger.

**Containment Procedures:** Every 5 days, a routine sweep of high-traffic image-sharing sites must be conducted to locate any new instances of SCP-D0G3-J. Any instances of SCP-D0G3-J found during routine sweeps must be downloaded onto a secured site computer and deleted from all website servers the memetic may be stored on. Personnel exhibiting symptoms of exposure to SCP-D0G3-J must be administered class B amnestics. If symptoms persist, termination is considered to be a viable solution.

**Description:** SCP-D0G3-J refers collectively to a form of memetic hazard propagated through social media and image-sharing websites. Though each instance varies, all instances of SCP-D0G3-J depict a Shiba Inu, often laying down. Most instances involve grammatically incorrect two-word phrases and photoshopped images to instigate a comedic response in the viewer. The Shiba Inu depicted in all instances of SCP-D0G3-J is assumed to be the catalyst of the memetic effect, as it is the only non-varying element between instances.

The effects of exposure to SCP-D0G3-J vary with each instance, though the most common effect of exposure is change in speech patterns. Persons exposed to SCP-D0G3-J will gradually begin to use short, grammatically incorrect phrases in everyday conversations, to the point that they are unable to communicate with those not exposed to SCP-D0G3-J. Phrases emitted from affected persons include:
* &#34;much wow&#34;
* &#34;such meme&#34;
* &#34;amaze&#34;
* &#34;very food&#34;
* &#34;much anomaly&#34;

Those affected by SCP-D0G3-J use the words &#34;very,&#34; &#34;much,&#34; &#34;such,&#34; and &#34;wow,&#34; more often that would be typical in the average conversation. Much converse, very confuse. This effect is present in text written by those affected by SCP-D0G3-J as well. When interrogated, persons affected by SCP-D0G3-J are oblivious to its effects, and will act as if they are talking or writing normally.
Such anomaly is much danger b cuz it would be bad if everyone had and didn&#39;t know. Peeplez who speak much weird must be very examined and have much amnestic if need. Such examination. Lots anomaly. Peeples working with SCP-D0G3-J must go get lots test to make sure no anomaly is very affect.

**Much Log. Such Conversation:**

&gt; //Researcher Cullhart:// Could you tell me how you were initially exposed to SCP-D0G3-J?
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject D0G3-3:// Much internet. Lots memes.
&gt; 
&gt; //Researcher Cullhart:// You were looking at memes on the internet?
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject D0G3-3:// Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; //Researcher Cullhart:// And when did you start exhibiting symptoms of exposure to SCP-D0G3-J?
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject D0G3-3:// Lots people. Says talk weird.
&gt; 
&gt; //Researcher Cullhart:// Lots notice?
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject D0G3-3:// Much noticing. Such weird.
&gt; 
&gt; //Researcher Cullhart:// Much interview. Very done.

Researcher Cullhart has been removed from studies of SCP-D0G3-J and given doses of class B amnestics. A full recovery is expected.
