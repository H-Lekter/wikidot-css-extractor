Don&#39;t talk to me about no fuckin&#39; urban legends. Jesus, in our line o&#39; work, you&#39;d think you&#39;d know better.

Whadda I mean? I mean they ain&#39;t just fuckin&#39; stories, dipshit. Oh, fine, some of &#39;em are. I mean, sure, no gangbanger&#39;s gonna shoot you just &#39;cause you flashed your headlights. But a lot of &#39;em ain&#39;t. Why don&#39;t nobody hear about &#39;em? Why don&#39;t they hear &#39;bout no fuckin&#39; skips? We ain&#39;t the only ones dancin&#39; in this here party, ya know?

No, I ain&#39;t fulla shit. Look, I&#39;ll tell you how I know they&#39;re real.

Okay, so this was a while back. I was out huntin&#39; elves in Jersey. What? They was short, had pointy ears, an&#39; squeaky voices. That&#39;s good enough for me. Were they really elves? Probably not. Sure as hell didn&#39;t bake no cookies. Do I give a shit what they&#39;re really called? No I do not. Anyways, don&#39;t interrupt.

So, I&#39;m off duty, having finished up for the day. I go drinkin&#39; at a dive in the bad side o&#39; town. Reminds me of home, right? So, there&#39;s this broad. She&#39;s cute, so I buy her a drink. One thing leads to another, an&#39; I go back t&#39;her place. No, it ain&#39;t professional, but what the fuck do you care what I do in my fuckin&#39; off-time? Jesus.

So, we have some drinks, make some small talk, an&#39; I suddenly find myself crashin&#39; harder&#39;n Buddy Holly an&#39; the Big Bopper. Yeah, you see where I&#39;m goin&#39; with this.

Thing is, the bit where you wake up in a bathtub, wit&#39; ice? Yeah, that&#39;s bullshit. They&#39;re takin&#39; yer fuckin&#39; kidneys. The fuck do they care if you live? You&#39;re just some random fuck who can point &#39;em out in a line-up. Best if you don&#39;t ever turn up.

Yeah, I&#39;m still alive. Thanks fer noticin&#39;. Y&#39;might also notice somethin&#39; they didn&#39;t account for, proper-like. I&#39;m a big fuckin&#39; guy. Three hundred pounds, hair under seven foot. There&#39;s a whole fuckin&#39; lot of me. An&#39; it takes a lot to take me down, an&#39; even more to keep me down. I wake up with this real bad pain in my side. I open my eyes, and there&#39;s this fuck with a scalpel openin&#39; me up. I put a stop to that really fuckin&#39; quick, believe me. I was a bit woozy, but I&#39;m a trained Foundation agent. They was a bunch of amateurs. It went down about how you&#39;d expect.

So don&#39;t talk to me about no fuckin&#39; urban legends.

Anyway, keep yer eyes open. This fucker with the hook&#39;s gotta show up sometime.</textarea></pre>
