It had to be bad. Like, really bad.  The director&#39;s voice was shaking when he called. He said something about &#34;emergency medical extraction&#34; before he hung up. 

&#34;You think this is some sort of containment breach?&#34; Lambert asked her boss as Medical Unit 16 crept closer and closer to Site 19&#39;s west wing. It was her first month on the job. She was still quite green.

&#34;Of course it&#39;s not,&#34; Mitchell replied. &#34;There&#39;d be alarms blaring all across the site. And they&#39;d be calling in a full on task force. Not us.&#34;

&#34;What if they&#39;re trying to be discreet?&#34;

&#34;That doesn&#39;t matter right now. All we know is that half of the west wing is knee deep in some sort of shit.&#34; 

Lambert started going through possible scenarios. Maybe it was an attack from the inside. Maybe they couldn&#39;t trust the MTFs anymore. Maybe it was some sort of memetic anomaly that was most susceptible to people without medical expertise. 

The unit approached the door to a senior scientist&#39;s office. Just before Mitchell opened it, the door swung out just far enough for a middle-aged man to pop his head out.

&#34;Kondraki! Good to see you&#39;re—&#34;

&#34;Yeah yeah I&#39;m fine. Just, did you bring everything?&#34;

&#34;Of course.&#34;

&#34;Even the lube?&#34;

Mitchell fumbled around in his backpack. &#34;I mean... it took a while to find some but yes.&#34;

&#34;And the pliers?&#34;

Lambert jumped in. &#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34;

&#34;I want to be clear. I had nothing to do with this. I mean, not this time anyway,&#34; Kondraki answered.

&#34;Okay?&#34;

&#34;I&#39;ll let you tend to them then.&#34;

Kondraki opened the door the rest of the way. There were twelve men just looking at their crotches with a mixture of embarrassment and disappointment. As one normally would when one&#39;s dick is stuck in a water bottle.

&#34;Wha—&#34;

One of the men spoke up. &#34;I mean, we were curious.&#34;

&#34;There was that one power point and like... I just wanted to know what that was even like. I couldn&#39;t tell if it was arousing or painful,&#34; another added.

&#34;You— you literally went against an O5 order for this,&#34; Mitchell responded.

&#34;Yeah, but... like I could not tell they were serious.&#34;

&#34;Is Gears ever kidding?&#34;

&#34;No, but like, it was //just so stupid//. So stupid we had to try it.&#34;

&#34;That makes no sense!&#34;

Lambert turned to Mitchell, whose face had gone pale. You couldn&#39;t blame him though. He was looking at a room full of his superiors with their dicks stuck in water bottles. And it was his job now to //get them out//.

&#34;Can we— can we just get this over with?&#34;

Mitchell swallowed. &#34;Yeah. Yeah. I mean... yeah.&#34;

And Medical Unit 16 got to work.

------

&gt; Dear Sergeant Edward Mitchell,
&gt; 
&gt; I am writing to submit my official request for transfer from Medical Unit 16 to Medical Unit 27 based in Site 23. 
&gt; 
&gt; I am requesting this transfer on the grounds of the incident that occurred on 05/21/2018 whereby our unit was instructed to extract the genitals of Site 19 personnel from Class-3 plastic liquid containment vessels. While this did warrant medical assistance, this sort of activity was not a part of the job description. 
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to continue my service to the Foundation, albeit not in the presence of men whose dicks I have handled. Thus this request for transfer.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope you understand.
&gt; 
&gt; Sincerely, Sarah Lambert</textarea></pre>
