“So you’re saying you found a can?”

“Yup.”

“And this can is… a Cart?”

“Yuuuuup.”

“So the can’s a Cart.”

“That’s what I’ve been saying.“

“You sure this can isn’t a Can?”

“Yeah. The can’s in a cart, though.”

“What kind of Cart is it?”

“The cart’s not a Cart.”

“Well what is it?”

“The cart’s a Can.”

“So the can’s on a Can?”

“No, the Cart’s on the Can. The can’s a Cart.”

“Well, what’s the Cart on?”

“It’s just on the ground, I guess.”

“You said the Cart was on a cart!”

“No, there’s only one cart. The Cart’s on top of it.”

“So there’s a cart on the Cart, and the Cart’s on the ground.”

“Yes.”

“What’s in the cart?”

“A can.”

“What’s in the can?”

“A cart.”

“So they’re inside each other?”

“No! The can is in the cart, and the Cart is in the Can!”

“What’s in the Cart?”

“I dunno.”

“You dunno?”

“I dunno. I don’t have a can opener.”

“So you haven’t opened the Can?”

“No.”

“Then how do you know the Cart’s in the Can?”

“It’s not, the can’s in the cart. Hang on, Agent Watt’s here.”

“Who’s there?”

“No, Watt’s here. Hu retired.”

“Put him on the phone.”

“Who?”

“No, Watt.”

“What?”

“Yes.”

“Yes, what?”

“Yes, Watt.”

“What?”

“Put him on the phone!”

“Hymn’s back at the office, call him yourself.”

“Whatever. So what’s up with the Cart and the Can?”

“No, Watt’s next to me.”

“What’s next to you?”

“Yes.”

“So what’s up with the Cart and the Can?”

“No! Watt’s right here! Hang on, he’s going up to the can.”

“Who?”

“No, Watt. Hu retired.”

“What’s going on?”

“No, Watt’s going up.”

“So what’s up with the cart?”

“Yes.”

“What?”

“Yes!”

“Hang on, remind me. What’s in the can?”

“No. The Cart’s in the Can. Watt’s next to them.”

“I dunno, what are you asking me for?”

“What?”

“Where’s Watt?”

“Where’s what?”

“Yes.”

“What?”

“Yes!”

“WHAT?”

“YES!”
