Addendum-1
SCP-5294-1
Instances of SCP-5294-1 are humanoid creatures with 4 legs and a cylindrical body with all features lost but their ears and mouth all of the rest of their body is mouths, once a instance of SCP-5294-1 are hostile it will let out the same high pitched screaming of SCP-5294 and make more instances of SCP-5294-1, in case of a breach of SCP-5294-1 incinerators have been placed around its containment to burn all instances that have escaped. Tests with SCP-5294-1 shows that the instances are not intelligent in anyway, and only have the purpose of infecting humans.SCP-5294-1 instances have no sense of pain, smell, or sight and uses their ears to hear humans. All instances of SCP-5294-1 are to be kept in a sound proof metal room for further testing.</textarea></pre>
