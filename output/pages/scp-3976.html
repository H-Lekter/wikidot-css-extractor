**Item #:** SCP-3976

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation webcrawlers and personnel are to monitor media channels for any signs of an SCP-3976 manifestation. Once detected, containment and security personnel under the guise of UK national law enforcement are to be dispatched to the site of SCP-3976 to secure a perimeter and investigate the manifestation.

**Description:** SCP-3976 is the collective term for a series of manifestations of apparent murder scenes of famous mystery writer Agatha Christie[[footnote]] Christie died of natural causes in 1976. [[/footnote]]. Thus far, every SCP-3976 instance has been located in rural England, and all components of each instance have been limited to a 50 meter radius. Additionally, every instance has appeared between the hours of 22:31 and 08:36, local time, although no records or witnesses of a manifestation event exist. 

Each SCP-3976 instance consists of the following components:

* A copy of the corpse of Agatha Christie[[footnote]] Christie&#39;s corpse was exhumed for comparison and control, and has been confirmed to be a separate object from the manifested corpse. However, DNA analysis has shown that the copies are genetically identical to Christie&#39;s real corpse. [[/footnote]], designated SCP-3976. In each recorded instance, the corpse shows signs of violent struggle or murder.
* A number of items in some way related to murder. For instance, a murder weapon such as a gun or knife, or a personal artifact, such as a piece of jewelry or a diary.

In no recorded SCP-3976 instance have there been any witnesses to a killing.

|| SCP-3976-5 || September 22, 2007, Broad Chalke. Corpse was found in the back room of a local grocery.|| Corpse contained no visible signs of trauma, but forensic analysis determined that it contained high levels of arsenic. || A sandwich with a bite taken out of it was found on the floor next to the corpse. In addition, a small golden ring was found in the sandwich.|| News of the manifestation reached local media before Foundation intervention, requiring a medium scale cover-up scheme. ||

|| SCP-3976-18 || January 5, 2018, Site 112. Corpse was found in the office of Dr. Sipai. || Corpse was wearing a standard issue Foundation lab coat, and had identification for one &#34;Dr. Christie&#34;[[footnote]] The ID card was found to have valid level 2 clearance. [[/footnote]]. Its skull cavity was found to be filled with teeth. || A trail of muddy footprints apparently leading into a solid wall was found adjacent to the body. The labcoat was found to have a toothbrush in one of its pockets. Security camera footage is missing from 01:23 to 1:25 of the day of the event.|| In response to this event, all UK based Foundation sites have been briefed on SCP-3976. ||
