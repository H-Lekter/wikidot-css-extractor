**09/09/████**

Today I discovered a new anomaly.

The Jealousy of man.

Hear me out, it&#39;s not ordinary.

People get jealous, and it ruins them. It causes them to spend every waking second they have attempting to ruin another person&#39;s life and take what they have. Jealousy is a memetic phenomenon, and it&#39;s destroying all of us.

One

By

One.

------

**09/10/████**

I&#39;ve discovered another anomaly.

Nighttime isn&#39;t normal. Nighttime strips us of our energy. Nighttime causes us to go to sleep

No this isn&#39;t normal everyone thinks it is.

But they don&#39;t see it.

We&#39;re meant to be meant to be awake, spending 24 hours showing the world what we can do.

But then

This motherfucking sleep comes along and strips it away

It&#39;s not normal

------

**09/11/████**

Why do some people not understand that I am very smart

**09/12/████**

------

**09/14/████**

------

**09/15/████**

**Item #:** SCP-0000

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-0000 cannot be contained.

**Description:** SCP-0000 is the jealousy of man. SCP-0000 has affected an estimate of 78% of the population. The origin of SCP-0000 is unknown, but it has been discovered that SCP-0000 can be provoked by intense emotion.

SCP-0000 was initially believed to be an ordinary human emotion. On 09/09/████, while investigating an unrelated call, Agent Scarlett witnessed a child kick the ground and explode. It is assumed that she was jealous of another child&#39;s toy.

------

I think that sounds good

++ Additional Notes

++++ By Prof. Elizabeth Wilbert

[[/=]]

The logs seen above were written by POI-44008 (previously Dr. Epon Scarlett). POI-44008 is a reality altering entity (class undetermined), and is immune to amnestics and memetic hazards. Its location is currently unknown. Any information/updates regarding POI-44008 are to be reported to Prof. Wilbert as quickly as possible.

POI-44008 was scheduled for demotion due to reckless behavior. After demotion along with removal from the Foundation at a later date, it still had access to Foundation files. The Foundation was alerted, and investigation is ongoing.
