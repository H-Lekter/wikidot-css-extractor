These are all things I love. I like to list things I love because they&#39;re pretty much all I have left. I love when they allow me to practice magic during testing and I get to yell &#39;abracadabra!&#39; with pride. 

Most people in this situation likely don&#39;t take it as well as I do. Most probably kick and scream and ignore demands, do everything in their power to attempt to escape. But I find it goes much easier for me if I just listen to what they say. I&#39;ve found that compliance lets me have cool things like fuzzy blankets and books to read.

Luna used to tell me I could find joy in anything, and she&#39;s probably right. I do miss being Flina, but &#34;SCP-0749&#34; has a certain charm to it that I don&#39;t mind. It sounds cool, kind of like I&#39;m a robot, or from the future.  I don&#39;t mind being here, it makes me feel like I&#39;m part of something important. 

Though I do suppose I miss seeing my friends. Maisie doesn&#39;t do well with loneliness. She was like baby duck following behind its mom. &#34;What item goes on this display? Where does this display go? Isn&#39;t X display supposed to be in Y section? Can someone fix it? I don&#39;t know how!&#34; That does make me feel better about her being here though. Maisie will likely just listen to what they tell her. Though it might make her sad, which isn&#39;t good.

That makes me think of Alize. Alize is a leader, not a follower. I just know that she&#39;s making this as difficult for herself as possible. She&#39;s probably tried using her magic to escape. I wish I could talk with her. There&#39;s nothing we can do about this. So we&#39;re caught in some science lab. Why not make the best of it? I hope Alize will realize that.

I&#39;m not quite sure how Xavier is reacting. He was basically a piece of clay, flexible with multiple different purposes, but would take a firm shape and not let anyone mold him when the time came to it. I remember when we had that one super rude customer that brought Maisie to tears. Xavier practically threw that woman through a wall. In fact, he would have, if Alize hadn&#39;t caught the poor woman with her wand. I just hope he&#39;s doing well.

I wonder the most about Luna.

Luna.

Where to start with Luna.

They looked at Luna differently that day. While they were interested in the four of us as part of a collection, she was the shiny penny. They split us up immediately, so there&#39;s no way to really know what happened.

But I can still feel it. Luna didn&#39;t get locked in a cage. Luna was the smartest of all of us. We were surprised that with all her degrees and education, that she just decided to stay low and run a fashion shop. I always told Luna that she could change the world. She always insisted that I was wrong.

It was only a matter of time that she would see that I was right.

I hope Luna enjoys being a doctor. Most of the doctors I talk to are distant and professional, but at least they&#39;re polite. I can&#39;t really tell if it&#39;s the work they enjoy, or if it&#39;s just me. The stuff they&#39;re doing is important, right? Shouldn&#39;t you enjoy doing something important?. Now I may just be your simple twenty-four year old witch, but I have a feeling that much more dangerous magic exists in the world. If they&#39;re keeping //me// locked up, I can only imagine the kinds of other things they must be dealing with. I appreciate them keeping the world safe. 

I never really thought of myself as dangerous before. I thought that good magic was okay to see. But I suppose the knowledge of any magic could be harmful. You don&#39;t want people trying to find out about good magic, only to be faced with harmful magic. 

Now that I think about it, I believe Luna and I have encountered some of the bad magic. We were just fourteen, it was after school in the park.

It was cute. I wanted to hug it.

Luna told me it looked mean.

I didn&#39;t listen.

Blood gushes from Luna&#39;s face.

Magic stops the bleeding.

Magic doesn&#39;t remove the scar.

That day was my fault.

Not only that one, but the other one. The reason we&#39;re all here. I wanted to expand our audience, so we could spread joy to more people. And, just like that day when we were kids, I didn&#39;t listen to Luna.

Maisie could be terrified and lonely.

Alize could be suffering and angry.

Xavier could be confused and hurt.

Luna.

Luna could be living a life she never wanted.
