Roland was on his death bed, practically coughing up his lungs. The ex-politician had a type of cancer, throat cancer, to be exact. So, while he was on the verge of death, his wife Nancy was off fucking some lawyer she knew or something. Who knows, I don&#39;t care. What? Do you think I&#39;m being paid to write this or something? Yeah, exactly. Now shut up about specifications and read the damn thing.

Nancy was currently with said lawyer, taking it from behind. She heard her phone ring over her and the lawyer&#39;s moans that they were making due to the aggressive hot and steamy gamer sexy sex that they were having, moving to answer it.

//&#34;Hello?&#34; &#34;Yes, uh, Mrs. Re-Ra-Reg-ah fuck it whatever the fuck his last name is I don&#39;t get paid enough for this shit. Yeah. Your husband&#39;s about to die, and there&#39;s some small blue fucker trying to see him.&#34; &#34;k&#34;// Nancy hung up the phone, telling the lawyer to fuck off before driving to the hospital. Once there, she stormed into the building like the absolute woman boss she was, going to her husband&#39;s hospital room. She walked in to hear one of the doctors saying to Donald[[footnote]] this is still regan [[/footnote]][[footnote]] i&#39;m intentionally spelling his name wrong every time i write it it&#39;s part of the plot i swear [[/footnote]], //&#34;Maybe if you got rid off that yeeyee ass-&#34;// Yeah, it cuts off there. Why? That familiar blue fucker came in and rammed the doctor into the wall with his super --seed-- speed. Then, Sonic the Hedgehog© turned towards Nancy while crying.

//&#34;How could you do this to that hot and sexy man?! He deserves better than you! He&#39;s over here on the verge of death, and you&#39;re out fucking some lawyer!&#34; &#34;What the hell even are you?&#34;// While the two bickered, Ragu was trying to get their attention because he was literally about to die. They only noticed when they heard the machine flatline, both of them turning their heads over to look. Nancy just shrugged and left to go fuck some old dude a few rooms over, but Sonic the Hedgehog© stood there in shock. Tears rolled down his cheeks as he walked over, holding Yu-Gi-Oh&#39;s[[footnote]] still regan [[/footnote]] hands in his. He silently stood there, staring down at the male&#39;s face.

//&#34;Why?&#34;// He asked himself, //&#34;Why did it have to be you?&#34;// After a few more seconds of silence, Sonic the Hedgehog© burst out into tears, his wails and sobs echoing throughout the hospital. The lawyer had randomly showed up and was now fucking Nancy in one of those really fucking small bathrooms in the rooms that some hospitals have while this was happening. Yet, of course, this has to come to an end. Someone had planted a bomb in the boiler room of the hospital, which had exploded and blown up the entire hospital soon after Ronald McDonald had died.

Boom everyone&#39;s dead story over now where&#39;s my Grammy.

Wait this has to be somehow SCP-related doesn&#39;t it
