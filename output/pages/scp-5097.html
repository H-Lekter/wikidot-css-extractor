**Anomaly №:** SCP-5097

**Anomaly Class:** Uncontained

**Threat Level:** Green

**Special Containment Procedures:** In the event SCP-5097 returns to reality, it is to be severely reprimanded and placed in a humanoid containment cell.

The note SCP-5097 left behind is currently held in an Anomalous Items locker.

**Description:** SCP-5097 is [[[Somnambulant Directives Take The Helm |Senior Researcher]]] [[[Hurt |Kassidy Kara]]], a former member of the Unreality Department[[footnote]] Up until their classification as SCP-5097, Dr. Kara had worked under the Foundation for 6 years. [[/footnote]]. On 4/8/2020, Dr. Kara removed themself from baseline reality and temporally ceased existing.

**Discovery Log:** SCP-5097 was discovered after Foundation .aic units detected a sudden loss of data associated with Dr. Kara[[footnote]] Their personnel file was the first to be detected as missing. Their reports on multiple anomalies were found to be blanked shortly after, followed by their SCiPnet account becoming invalid. [[/footnote]] at 9:58 PM on 4/9/2020. At the same time, several personnel acquainted with Dr. Kara had noticed their lack of activity around the Site, and could neither access past e-mails with Dr. Kara nor send them new ones.

An investigation was launched, revealing their private quarters contained only a handwritten note on their desk (see Addendum). Whom it was addressed to is unknown.

Automated extranormal detection programs deployed by Site Command were able to recognize several residual [[[SCP-5850 |olf]]][[footnote]] Hypothetical measurements used to quantify anti-dimensions or anti-spacetime phenomena within a given system. Olf values closer to 0 operate similarly to our reality. [[/footnote]] fluctuations that had occurred within Dr. Kara&#39;s quarters. From the readings, a timeline of these fluctuations was established, revealing Dr. Kara had separated themself from baseline reality on 4/8/2020, at approximately 4:25 AM. 

Dr. Kara was designated as SCP-5097 on 4/10/2020, and its containment procedures were officialized shortly after.

**Addendum:** The note left by SCP-5097.
