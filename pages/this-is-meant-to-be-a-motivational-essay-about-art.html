I taught myself how to watercolour when I was 9 years old. At the beginning of Doing Art (tm) I put the cart first, and then found my horse. I got used to the feeling of the brush on the paper, how the paint reacted when mixed with too much water or not enough. I got a feel of the flow of the water on the page, I got the feel of how it pulled the colour. 

My first paintings were watery messes. Outlines of mountain tops were rounded off and drippy. I personally don&#39;t like my early attempts, but I&#39;m sure someone //would// like the paintings. Because there was //something else there// outside of the academic paradigm of How to Make Art (tm). 

I was //playing//.

I was //experimenting//.

I had gotten the physical feeling for the paints, and how the colours mixed together.

I knew the colours of the rainbow, but when I started to learn colour theory in my 5th grade art class (at 11 years old), the quality of my paintings went up. I had found my horse.

Later on, learning other fundamentals like perspective and the rule of thirds, etc., only helped the quality of my paintings. //But// I feel I wouldn&#39;t have the sort of intuition and understanding that I have for art now at 31 years old if I **hadn&#39;t** put my cart first. I got the chance to //play// with art. I got the chance to //play// with my preferred medium before receiving any sort of formal training/education.

When I went to college (the first time) I took an introductory drawing course. The professors were abusive asshats but I picked up some knowledge, tools, and techniques that have helped my paintings regardless. (Semi-blind, and blind contour drawing are AMAZING techniques!)

If I hadn&#39;t taken any of these classes or received any type of advice, I feel I would have come across a portion of it via trial and error, via //playing// with my chosen medium.

This is personally how I view (and judge... sorry) art. Does it feel like the artist is //playing// with their medium? Does it feel like the artist is //playing// with the subject matter of the piece? As an artist, do you feel like you&#39;re //playing// with your piece?

--//Does the piece feel cool yet?//--

Go out and //play// with your art. Go out and //play// with your digital tablet and Krita. Go out and //play// with graphite on notebook paper. Go out and //play// with crayola watercolours bought from Walmart.
