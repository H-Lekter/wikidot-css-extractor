Special containment procedures: SCP-6046 is to be contained in its cell a 12 m x 10 m x 12 m chamber with 0.4m thick walls. Daily checks for any escape attempts are mandatory. There are to be no visits from level 0-4 or above personal. Only Class D and low level researchers are permitted to visit 6046. No more than 2 people from different Classes are allowed in SCP-6046’s chamber at a time. Class D and Researchers are required to have a mask of Decomposed flesh on hand in case SCP-6046 becomes hostile. 

If SCP-6046 becomes hostile and personal is unable to put on the mask the other must quarantine in case of 6046’s affects 

Description: SCP-6046 is a humanoid creature measuring 1.78 meters in height. The subject is shown to have a big muscle mass, with thick,long and sharp spikes growing and hurting itself until it reaches 2.9 meters in length each. Skin is rotten leaving a foul odor that is used as a way to disguise personnel. No signs of damage from anything other than the spikes can be seen on 6046’s body.

SCP-6046’s head can be detached and will grow spikes which only take a few moments to grow. It can move at a speed of 25 mph while the body’s speed can only go up to 13 mph. When detached the body is left unable to move it loses all senses and abilities, the spikes begin to return to its original state of 0.3 meters sticking outside of the body.

SCP-6046 at most times it is docile it shall only become hostile when 1: threatened 2: attacked 3:given an ominous off putting sense.It will spend most of its days crawling around the chamber trying to find any escape methods. When someone is to set off either 3 of the key causes of hostility SCP-6046 will begin to tear off the head and lift itself to the highest place it can. There is an approximate three (3) to five (5) minute window before SCP-6046 begins to leap at the person and begin to tear off the person&#39;s limbs and begin to dissect them.

From the foundation&#39;s current  understanding SCP-6046 only dissects them to learn more about humanity. Sometimes it will show signs of pleasure,guilt or nothing at all after dissection.

If the SCP grows an attachment to personal it will try to protect them and give the personal a shield made out of stitched together decomposed flesh of multiple different beings over layering graphene</textarea></pre>
