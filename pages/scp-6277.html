**Special Containment Procedures:** When not used, SCP-6277 is to be kept in a standard-security item locker with a password changed monthly. Requests to test SCP-6277 require written Level 3 approval. Under no circumstances is SCP-6277 to be brought within 5 meters of any anomalous objects.

**Description:** SCP-6277 is a key, similar in shape to a modern house key, appearing to be made out of living biological matter. Its current size is 10 cm, however, it has shown the ability to expand and contract when used. The temperature of SCP-6277 is always at 37.2 degrees, slightly warmer than a human&#39;s internal temperature.
Its anomalous effects activate whenever SCP-6277 is used as a key. When SCP-6277 is brought within 1 meter of any object capable of being locked, SCP-6277 will change shape to a form that will be able to lock said object. This includes electronic locks and devices. If SCP-6277 is brought near an object incapable of being locked, it will not change shape.
When handling SCP-6277, subjects report feeling a pulse, similar to a heartbeat. The pulse gradually shifts to match the subject&#39;s heartbeat. Feelings of disgust have been determined to be non-anomalous in nature.

**Acquisition:** SCP-6277 was acquired by a Foundation front at a Marshall, Carter, and Dark LLC auction. Due to the nature of many of the other attendees and the security measures in place, a raid was deemed too high-risk. Instead, Agent M. Rine was tasked with infiltrating the auction for the purpose of gathering information on the attendees and the items sold. In order to maintain cover, the agent was instructed to place bids on various low-value items, including SCP-6277. The mission was considered a success, with Agent M. Rine relaying large amounts of information on multiple POIs, GOIs, and anomalous objects.

**Testing Log**

|| **Item** || **Reaction by SCP-6277** ||
|| Common door lock (unlocked) || SCP-6277 formed into a duplicate of the key required to lock the door ||
|| Common door lock (locked) || Same results as above, however, SCP-6277 was unable to unlock the door, despite being the correct shape ||
|| Garage door (remote activated) || SCP-6277 formed into a transmitter similar to the actual remote, but only the &#34;close door&#34; and &#34;lock door&#34; buttons had any result ||
|| Laptop || SCP-6277 took the form of a USB drive. When plugged in, it immediately ran a program that brought the laptop back to its lock screen ||
|| High-security safe || Despite the multiple layers of security required to lock the safe, SCP-6277 was able to bypass the security measures and lock the safe within 15 seconds of being in proximity. Of note is that locking the safe by non-anomalous means took, on average, 55 seconds longer. ||
|| SCP-████ || When SCP-6277 was brought near SCP-████, **{{[Redacted]}}** explosive force determined to be roughly 9 gigajoules. Recontainment achieved █ days later with █ personnel deaths and ██ admitted to the medical ward. Containment procedures updated accordingly. ||
