**Item #:** SCP-6054

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** The website containing SCP-6054 is to be closed to all public access via [REDACTED] measures. Logs of entry and other activity is to be closely monitored at all times by staff. In the rare case that SCP-6054 is activated, the user who has activated 6054 will be tracked down and administered Class C amnestics to wipe the user&#39;s memories of ever activating SCP-6054. This will keep the anomalous entity designated as SCP-6054-1 from appearing. A duplicate website was created for public access, without SCP-6054. The duplicate site is also closely monitored for any anomalous games&#39; appearances

**Description:** SCP-6054 takes the form of a user-shared game on the coding website Scratch. The game has no title, and the user who created this game has no name. Research into how this game was made reveals that there is no code inside, nor any traces of the game being created by a real user.

In the event that SCP-6054 is played, the game will flicker through different photos of an entity bearing a close resemblance to the character &#34;Scratch Cat&#34;, the main character and mascot of the Scratch website. The photos depict the entity in locations where the user activating the game was previously.

After SCP-6054 is closed, the entity, designated SCP-6054-1, depicted in the game will begin to manifest during select periods throughout the day, and will manifest more often during the hours of night.

SCP-6054-1 takes the form of a 2.1 meter tall humanoid. As with the photos, SCP-6054-1 roughly resembles a twisted version of the character Scratch Cat. Research on a sample of the exterior layer of &#34;skin&#34; on 6054-1 shows that it is made of an unknown substance. The interior of an SCP-6054-1 instance reveals it has no internal organs, but it does appear to have a skeleton, appearing similar in shape to a skeleton of a regular human, with certain modifications to accommodate the form of Scratch Cat, some of which include a different skull shape and tail bones to accommodate the tail. Many 6054-1 instances have areas of skin missing, exposing the skeleton underneath. The skeleton itself appears to be made of similar material as a normal human skeleton.

6054-1 will continue to stalk the user who played the game for days or several weeks. Once 6054-1 deems necessary, 6054-1 will close the distance between itself and the victim. 6054-1 is reported to move similarly to the movement animation frames found in the original Scratch Cat on the website. Once 6054-1 is close enough to the victim, 6054-1 will attack and kill the victim via blunt force and/or consuming parts of the victim. Many victims are found with their heads missing, as well as scratch marks and other injuries, although how the scratch marks appeared is unknown as 6054-1 appears to lack claws. Following the death of the victim, the SCP-6054-1 instance will disappear.</textarea></pre>
