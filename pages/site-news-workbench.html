+++ The Riemann Conjecture
[[span class=&#34;s-title&#34;]]//Olber’s Paradox //[[/span]]
[[/=]]


There are a couple of immutable truths in the universe. That it’s static, infinitely old, and that the night sky is full of so many stars that’s infinitely bright and it fucking burns my retinas. Stars everywhere. An incredibly dense wall of light with endless rays subtended by endless angles. You open your mouth to scream but it’s also full of stars. 


This is known as Olber’s Paradox, and was one of the first hints that the universe was more complicated than we gave it credit for. With the dawn of the Copernican model[[footnote]] A helio-centric solar system [[/footnote]] and Newtonian gravity, we found ourselves dealing with two fundamental questions.

The first was that if the earth was not the center of the universe, what was? Was there even a center? And more pressingly, Newtonian mechanics required an infinite and homogenous universe so as not to collapse under its own weight. So how many stars were there? And how bright should the night sky be? Let’s consider a spherical shell of thickness //dr//, homogenous star number density //n//, and radius //r//. For simplicity, we’re going to assume all stars have the same radius as our sun - [[$r^{2}_{\odot}~=~7~\times~10^8~m~$]]. 

This would give us [[$4 \pi r^{2} dr n~$]] stars in this shell, where each would cover fraction [[$\pi r^{2}_{\odot} dr n~$]] of the night sky. So! For a section of the sky roughly the size of the sun (from our point of view!), we can look at [[$\pi r^{2}_{\odot} R n~$]] and find //R// such that this fraction is equal to 1. 

Now, you may notice that this fraction goes linearly with //R//. And that //R//, the radius that we’re integrating out to, is infinity. 

Obviously that’s kind of a problem. Stars will definitely occlude other stars, so a cylindrical cross section would be a more accurate integral, but this is a writing website and not a maths class. So I think it’s suffice to say that any nonzero stellar density will result in this section of the sky being entirely full of stars from our eyes. The entirety of the night sky is about 180,000 times larger than that singular patch, so naturally the night sky is 180,000 times more intense than sunlight. 

Wait. Shit. 

Ok, ok. What if the stars are just arranged in a pattern where they’re all hiding behind the ones we can see? What, that’s weird and disquieting? Uh, ok, ok. What if there was some interstellar medium that was absorbing the light? Yeah! Yeah, ok. Ok. So there’s some interstellar medium, let’s say dust[[footnote]]Anything in space that is not measured in solar masses is dust[[/footnote]]. And it’s absorbing 180,000 times the energy of the sun at any given moment. Hold on, I’m getting a call from my thermodynamicist. 

Ok - she’s telling me that there’s no material that can infinitely absorb energy and that it would start diffusing energy once it’s reached thermal equilibrium. 

So… Where do we go from here? We all live in an era where things like the Big Bang (thanks Penzias and Wilson!) and accelerating expansion of the universe (thanks Riess and Perlmutter!) are commonplace and widely accepted. But this wasn’t always the case, and I think the fact that it took us till the early 20th century to properly dissuade ourselves of the notion speaks to how deep the belief in a static and infinite universe ran. But thanks to the efforts of cosmologists and astronomers like  Einstein, Friedmann, Walker, Robertson, Lemaitre, Hubble, and others, we now know the resolution to Olber’s Paradox. The night sky is not infinitely bright because the universe is //young//. Modern stars and galaxies formed 1-10 Gigayears after the Big Bang[[footnote]]Our error bars are in gigayears, yes.[[/footnote]]. And the universe is not endlessly irradiated because of its expansion - leftover radiation from the Big Bang has been redshifted into the microwave band. 

Until relatively recently, cosmology has relied on four key assumptions:

1. The laws of physics apply at all points.
2. The universe is homogenous.
3. The universe is static.
4. The universe is infinite.

Olber&#39;s paradox is only resolved because we now know that the last two assumptions are not true. And that&#39;s what makes Olber&#39;s so interesting. The universe is so much smaller but so much more interesting than we had ever thought it would be, and if it wasn&#39;t, well, I wouldn&#39;t have banged my dang knee the other night cause it was so dark. Because, as we all know, the night sky is full of stars.

+++ Captain&#39;s Log: Date 002
[[span class=&#34;s-title&#34;]]//Comedy 101: A Probability and Statistics Course//[[/span]]
[[/=]]

In theme with my fellow columnist completely disregarding our target demographic to write about cosmology, I decided I&#39;d one up him: I&#39;ll write about something nobody cares about on a writing site (math) and also something I have no qualification for (being funny). I do feel like I have to take this approach though, since humor is generally considered such a flippant and nebulous genre to write. The rules of comedy has always been:

&gt; 1. If they laugh, you&#39;ve done it right
&gt; 2. There is no second rule

So, instead of talking about what goes into making an individual joke land, I want to take a look at how jokes and comedy manifest in SCP articles specifically. Be it a -J or a funny mainlister, SCP humor has to find a way to make a reader laugh (or at least smirk) within the confines of the format.[[footnote]] Yes, I see you in the back with your hand up. Yes I have heard of format screws. We&#39;re going to pretend they don&#39;t exist today. You can put your hand down.[[/footnote]] Approaches to the &#34;funny SCP&#34; challenge are incredibly diverse, so it&#39;s difficult to make broad sweeping remarks, or try to categorize them all. So, instead of using hand-wavey, poorly defined terms like &#34;stinger&#34; and &#34;tone&#34;, how about we talk about comedy in certain terms. Let&#39;s use some math.

I want to start by defining some measurements you can make in a comedic article:

# **Length (L):** It&#39;s literally just word count. It&#39;s always some non-negative integer.
# **Joke Count (J,,c,,):** The number of moments in the article where the reader is supposed to laugh. Also always a non-negative integer.
# **Joke Intensity (J,,i,,):** How funny any individual &#34;Joke Moment&#34; is supposed to be[[footnote]] Ok, so we&#39;re getting a //little// hand-wavey[[/footnote]]. If you&#39;re an economist you can quantify this as utility? I think?
# **Joke Success Rate (P(J)):** How likely any single joke is to land. It&#39;s just a probability so it&#39;ll always be some number between zero and one. 

Now that we&#39;ve defined these terms, we can use them to calculate things![[footnote]] Yaaay arithmetic![[/footnote]] We&#39;ll start with something that I think can be used to characterize comedic articles, and might even be a useful measure meant for your own joke articles! It&#39;s called **Joke Density (J,,d,,)**.

[[math]]
J_d = \frac{J_c}{L}
[[/math]]

It&#39;s the frequency of jokes in an article. Knowing that an article has only 1 joke or 10 jokes means something, but that changes if there&#39;s 1 joke in a 100 word article or 10 jokes in a 5000 word article.

Which now brings me to a joke-to-joke value we can calculate: **Expected Joke Intensity (E[J,,i,,])**. On its face, any individual joke for any single reader has one of two values: its joke intensity, or zero. It either lands, or it doesn&#39;t[[footnote]] Oh, you want to mention that jokes aren&#39;t equally funny for everyone because they have different senses of humor? Well, we&#39;re operating with large sample sizes so we get to assume that everyone follows a similar humor model that has some sort of average. We&#39;ll chalk &#34;sense of humor&#34; up to variance.[[/footnote]]. However, we can use the expected value of a joke&#39;s intensity to estimate, on average, how funny it will be for any given reader. Luckily, expected value is pretty easy to calculate here:

[[math]]
E[J_i] = J_i\times P(J)
[[/math]]

Now, preferably we want to maximize [[$ E[J_i] $]] for every joke in our article, but that&#39;s rarely the case. However, given that we can&#39;t necessarily always do this, we can see that different types of jokes can have similar [[$ E[J_i] $]]. For example, a joke that requires some obscure knowledge, but lands hard for its target audience could score the same as a more accessible joke that causes an exhale rather than a guffaw.

[[$ E[J_i] $]] is a useful value for talking about individual jokes, but how do we turn this into a measurement of an entire article? We would want to combine all of these values together. Now, the solution here seems obvious... you just add them together. Usually in probability, you don&#39;t just get to add probabilities together, but expected values abide by Linearity of Expectation[[footnote]][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value#Basic_properties I told you, the math is the part of this I am qualified to talk about.][[/footnote]]. So, if we defined all of the jokes in an article [[$ A $]] as the set [[$ A_J $]], then we can define **Expected Article Humor (E[A])** as:

[[math]]
E[A] = \sum_{J \in A_J} E[J_i]
[[/math]]

This tells us now how funny our article is in its entirety (in expectation)! Its a way to homogenize how articles with high quantities of jokes can sometimes equal a single high quality joke. But instead of looking at articles in some sort of monolithic categories, we now have a //continuous measurement// of how effective a comedy article is! We can compare rapid fire and shaggy dog, anecdote with knock knock. All humor bows before our numbers!

Except, we are still missing one last aspect, which we briefly mentioned before: time. See, people want to feel rewarded for their time investment in reading your article. So let&#39;s round this off with one final value: **Expected Laughter Frequency Per Article (E[L_t])**:

[[math]]
E[L_t] = E[A]/L
[[/math]]

And now, we have done it. A measurement to unify all humor articles. How much laughter you will get out of how much time investment. We can optimize all of our comedy, apply a minimum expected laughter frequency threshold, GATE KEEP HARDER.

Except well, there&#39;s the obvious issue that everyone probably pointed out at the very beginning: you can&#39;t really put numbers to like, most of this. 

Yeah, humor is subjective. But making sure //you as a writer// know what makes this worth reading //to you// is important. Do I have a high joke density with medium payoffs? Or am I promising my reader the funniest punchline they&#39;ve ever seen after 2000 words? Or maybe I just want to have the whole essence of the article be funny without any big set up, and let little consistent moments of humor bring the reader along? If you follow the steps above, and believe you&#39;re executing on these all correctly, they //should// come out to a similar [[$ E[L_t] $]]. 

Which brings me back to the first rule of comedy. &#34;iI they laugh, you&#39;ve done it right&#34;. If you go through these steps, and end up with a high enough value that you&#39;re happy with, that means at least one person should probably be laughing at your article. It&#39;s not like there&#39;s a correct way to go about writing humor, in the first place. All the different methods you&#39;ll see on the site have a chance at scoring highly on our silly little scale. But when you&#39;re  writing, you only have your guts to go off. This brings me to my proposed amendment to the first rule of comedy. Captain Kirby&#39;s new decree from on high. All writers who break this rule shall be stripped of their comedy license:

&gt; 1. If //you// laugh, you&#39;ve done it right
&gt; 2. There is no second rule

[[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/eddybird-art-page-or-sth |Eddybird&#39;s art page]]] was the highest rated page with **no** downvotes, with a huge +118! The highest rated article with no downvotes was [*http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/gamers-against-kaiju On The Internet, Nobody Knows You&#39;re A Kaiju] by [[*user stormbreath]] with +50. This makes it the second month running an article by stormbreath has achieved this!

If you haven&#39;t heard about [*http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6542 SCP-6542] yet, where have you been? It&#39;s quickly proved to be one of the most polarising articles on the site -- after 204 votes it&#39;s currently sat at +14. Similarly, after 57 votes [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5741 |SCP-5741]]] resides at +3.

The huge ≈250% increase in the top-rated GoI format from July to August is due to [[*user Fish^12]]&#39;s WWS article [*http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/critter-profile-big-blue Critter Profile: Big Blue!] hitting the upper echelons of the voting ranks.

In a complete opposite to July, through August TUESDAY was the most popular day to post (total of 29 articles) and SATURDAY was the least popular, with only 14!

What happened with the tags this month? Same as July, {{sentient}}, {{sapient}}, and {{humanoid}} were the top 3 tags, with 30, 24, and 22 tags respectively. 

When you compare July to August though: 
* {{online}} dropped from 6 tags in July to 0 this month. (Did we all go outside and touch grass during the last of the Summer sun?)
* {{alive}} jumped by 600% from 3 tagged article in July to 18 in August! The highest rated of which was [*http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6101 SCP-6101] by [[*user PeppersGhost]].
* We also had {{acoustic}} go from no tagged articles to 6 in August. The highest rated of this bunch was [*http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6150 SCP-6150] by [[*user Elenee FishTruck]] and [[*user TheYeIIowDucK]].

Former reporter for [EXPUNGED]. Likes writing, horror movies, and puppies. If you know of me, it&#39;s likely due to SCP-5733. Don&#39;t ask me how to pronounce my username.

Hexick is scared of people, and happy to be here! They much enjoy recording data, reading, writing, existential dread, computers, the outdoors, robotics, and a slew of other totally normal things. Likes helping out both on-site and in IRC, and tries to be very thorough; nothing gets past them. **{{//[Placeholder; staff summary goes here. Remember to remove this during finalization.]//}}**

Unhealth addiction to refreshing 05command, thought they might as well tell someone about it. Number one writer on the site named after a citrus fruit, because that&#39;s the bar we&#39;re setting.

Very old for a guy beginning his 20s. Remembers when Site News was sigma and bland-pilled and was hired out of the blue by a guy who wrote about racecar witches.

Riemann is a cosmologist[[footnote]] Which isn&#39;t an astronomer[[/footnote]] who should be spending their time writing papers rather than writing columns. No one believes that they ride a motorcycle.

International reporter! Knows everything about every branch of the Foundation. When he&#39;s not searching for nitpicks, he&#39;s reporting international news to our magazine. Don&#39;t make him notice that the correct spelling is &#34;Siddhartha&#34;. The world is not ready for it.

She do things on this site, probably. Give blurbs to the articles of the month. She managed (and still manage) to trick everyone into believing she read all the new articles. And it works well. Also, she loves blue hedgehogs.
