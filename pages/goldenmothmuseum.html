= Welcome to...

 
= //**GOLDEN MOTH MUSEUM AND R&amp;D**// 

Good day, visitor! Welcome to my museum and R&amp;D. Here at Golden Moth, we value the research and  preservation of only the highest quality artifac-

What&#39;s that?

The artifacts here aren&#39;t that good?

...

Well you can bugger off then.

----
+++ METAPHYSICS DEPARTMENT

Welcome to our Metaphysics department! It&#39;s a fledgling research department all about, you guessed it, the metaphysical world. 

++++ ARTIFACT #1
+++++ [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6043 SCP-6043]

Fun fact, the Golden Moth institution was founded after we discovered this marvelous specimen! We helped discover the mechanisms by which life functions in the metaphysical realm.
----
+++ EGYTPOLOGY DEPARTMENT

Ah! I see you&#39;ve found our Egyptology department! It&#39;s quite small so far but our teams are actively searching for more to put on display. Just across the corridor, to the left of our patented Crocodile Death Pit, you&#39;ll find a cat adoption center. Please do pay it a visit!

++++ ARTIFACT #1
+++++ [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6990 SCP-6990]

Our Egyptology research team had a lot of fun finding this one. Ever wondered about ancient aliens? Well, we finally have an explanation for that; this artifact!

----

+++ INTERNET CULTURE AND HISTORY

Welcome to our Internet Culture and History department! Despite it being staffed exclusively by teenaged interns who are payed in &#34;dank memes&#34;, the area is surprisingly clean! Do mind the stray memetic hazard.

++++ ARTIFACT #1
+++++ [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5273 SCP-5273]

This artifact was a joint project with the wonderful curator [[*user hungrypossum]]. Surprisingly enough this qualifies as an artifact, by our standards at least! We&#39;ve thoroughly scrubbed any and all memetic hazards from this artifact, so you should be free to look at it without worrying about waking up on a bathroom floor at 3 AM.

----

Well, that&#39;s the end of this guided tour! I sincerely hope you enjoyed this.

...yes that&#39;s it.

Yes, there&#39;s only 3 departments with 1 artifact each right now. But stay tuned! We&#39;re steali- pardon me, we&#39;re searching for more constantly! Keep checking back here to see what we&#39;ve got.</textarea></pre>
