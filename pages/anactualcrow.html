**[[[SCP-6590]]] - ULTIMATE SHOWDOWN** [[span class=&#34;collab]] [[user Modulum]][[/span]]
* When Woed first said that he was planning on hosting a memecon in the future, I decided that I would create an SCP version of Neil Cicierega&#39;s The Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny. The plan was that it would be a huge collab between singers, songwriters, and lyric writers. When Memecon was actually announced, however, there were two issues: it had to be a mainlist SCP article and the maximum team size was two. I knew that the article would be incomplete without a song, so I decided to collab with someone who could make the music while I wrote the narrative bulk of the article. [[*user Modulum]] wanted to hop on board. While he could make the instrumental, he had apprehensions about doing the vocals. I wasn&#39;t excited by the idea of using my lack of singing ability to the wiki, but we decided to cross that bridge when we got to it. Eventually, Modulum contacted [[*user Elunerazim]] to do the vocals. 
* This article almost didn&#39;t make it into the contest. It was posted in the last 20 minutes of the posting period. The song wasn&#39;t finished at the time and Woedenaz had to make a slight rule change so that we could edit the article and upload the song after the posting period had ended. 
* To me, this article felt like a spiritual successor to [[[SCP-5590]]], since they both have narratives revolving around a Foundation member&#39;s long-term struggle to contain an anomaly, which is shown through documents written by them and which ends with the member finding a silver bullet to their containment problem. Both articles are obviously different in a lot of ways, so I can definitely imagine my stance on this changing over time.
* I honestly don&#39;t know if anyone actually reads the author commentaries, but here&#39;s some //deep lore// for the anyone who does: the first time 6590 is mentioned is in the year 2000. The Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny came out in 2006. Since the Foundation acknowledges that some civilians saw 6590, the best explanation for this discrepancy is that in-universe Niel Cicierega saw 6590 and his version was inspired by the anomaly.

**[[[SCP-6003]]] - Beacon** [[span class=&#34;collab&#34;]] [[user PlaguePJP]] &amp; [[user J Dune]] [[/span]]
* The writing process for this was a mess. The concept and outline were shuffled around so many times that the only story elements that survived from the initial concept to the posted article were &#34;there&#39;s a lighthouse, everything is black and white, Swaine dies at the end&#34;. Initially, Swaine was the only researcher on the island and is told to investigate the anomaly and do a ritual every day for roughly 3 weeks or else something bad will happen. In reality, he was being sacrificed to the island because... reasons. He also had a wife whose death he was responsible for. One explanation I gave for why Swaine needed to die instead of a D-Class was that the O5&#39;s keep their immortality by occasionally sacrificing someone of a similar position[[footnote]]Because death is //natural//.[[/footnote]] and that Swaine was a potential successor for one of the O5&#39;s (or so he was told). The general plot shared by all of these outlines/drafts was that spooky stuff starts happening, Swaine realizes that the ritual is a sham, and then he dies. I say that the O5 immortality ritual was &#34;one explanation&#34; because the draft at the time was actually 2-3 strings of logs in different sandboxes (plus a google doc). None of these strings formed anything close to a coherent narrative[[footnote]] A side effect of this was that everything had random dates in the late 1900s that conflicted with each other. Dune had to go back and fix all the dates a day or two before we posted.[[/footnote]]. Our outline was written and rewritten multiple times by J Dune[[footnote]] These rewrites were allegedly the result of Dune going outside and touching grass on multiple separate occasions, but I find that hard to believe.[[/footnote]]. Somehow, we scraped all of our assorted logs into a draft. I don&#39;t have any of the critique we got on-hand, but people found the early versions of Beacon to be a little lacking[[footnote]]Except [[*user Ralliston]][[/footnote]]. They said that the island was too barren, and after we tried to fix it they said the draft had too many unrelated parts. Critters also thought that it was hard for us to develop Swaine as a character when all he had was himself and some chickens.
* I feel like the current version did a good job of addressing the issues of the early drafts. The ruins give the Foundation something to actually explore while also tying directly into the lighthouse. The overgrowth in said ruins makes nature a bigger part of the article. We also wrote in more than one character this time around. Big improvement overall, although it&#39;s a shame that we had to cut some really good logs that were written for the old versions.
* Another big change in the final version was how separated our work was. In the older versions, the three of us wrote logs and just sort of left them as-is. In the final version (especially near the end of the writing process) we were all sticking our hands into each other&#39;s logs and making revisions to the point where I feel like it would be unfair to say that any one person wrote any one log. Just about all of them became a team effort. 

**[[[SCP-5336]]] - Custom Print Settings** [[span class=&#34;collab&#34;]] [[user LordStonefish]] [[/span]]
* At first, I was very unsure about this article&#39;s ending so it was a pleasant surprise when all my critters really liked it. I guess the lesson here is that if you write something you enjoy then you&#39;ll find someone else who feels the same. I posted this during the voting period for jamcon because I was impatient and stupid, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the only reason this did a worse than my other articles. I imagine that  some people to dislike it for essentially speeding through the requirements of the SCP format (object class, special containment procedures, clinical tone, etc.) and doing its own thing. Regardless, I&#39;m happy with how it turned out and actually think that this is one of my best articles. I had a hell of a lot of fun writing the over-the-top prose.

**[[[SCP-5855]]] - Foot by The Fruit** [[span class=&#34;collab&#34;]] [[user Henzoid]] [[/span]]
* When I received [[*user Henzoid]]&#39;s unfinished draft for the [http://scpdsandbox.wikidot.com/scpd-draft-swap 2021 SCPD Draft Swap], I knew that the images had to be central to the article. My original draft of this was a much more standard (and vastly inferior) article before [[*user Uncle Nicolini]] convinced me to tie it into Annoying Orange. At first, drafting what was at the time known as &#34;The Annoying Orange Article&#34; felt a lot like what I image Robert Oppenheimer felt after creating the nuclear bomb. I&#39;ve since come around to realizing that the article itself is pretty funny.

**[[[SCP-5655]]] - Exactly the Kind of Genie You&#39;d Expect To Find in an Empty Can of Spam**
* I&#39;m really happy with how this article turned out[[footnote]] My only gripe used to be that the image was just sort of //there//, but I shot/edited a new picture a couple weeks after posting.[[/footnote]]. Most testing-focused articles create narrative by having a sense of escalation in their tests. However, the fact that every wish has a disappointing result meant that I couldn&#39;t properly add a feeling of escalation. [[*user Uncle Nicolini]] suggested that I focus on characterizing 5655-1 instead of developing a strong narrative. It was a pretty good suggestion.
* I realized about a month after posting 5655 that it had cannibalized the structure/punchline of another idea I was brainstorming at the time. In 1995, the ecosystem of Yellowstone was saved by reintroducing gray wolves. The idea for the article was that wolves are anomalously good at solving problems by doing normal wolf things. The joke was that letting a bunch of wild wolves run loose at a Foundation Site just so happens to solve a bunch of problems until researchers put wolves in the accounting offices and ask them to balance the Foundation&#39;s budget. The wolves hand the researchers a formal letter of resignation.

**[[[SCP-5455]]] - Walking Anthills**
* Walking Anthills was born from the ashes of another draft that I had been getting critique on for a while. People started telling me that the old draft wasn&#39;t very good horror. The only problem was that I didn&#39;t intend for it to be a horror article. The more that I thought about it, the more that I realized it wasn&#39;t intended to fit into any genre in particular. I started trying to rewrite it as a horror story, but kept feeling like I was handicapping myself by trying to convert an existing story into a horror story instead of just starting from scratch. In other words, the origin of SCP-5455 was &#34;I want to write a horror SCP&#34;. If you were wondering why (to quote [[*user Nagiros]]) &#34;the implementation here isn&#39;t particularly inspired&#34;, this is why. 
* That being said, 5455 was exactly what I needed at the time. The 6 months leading up to it were filled with me being too busy to write or spending months hopelessly trying to turn mediocre drafts into ok drafts. 5455 isn&#39;t groundbreaking, but it was the first time in a long while that I actually had //fun// writing.

**[[[SCP-5590]]] - That Little Bastard Robot**
* I don&#39;t have a lot to say about this one since it was posted roughly 8 months prior to me writing this. Hell, I haven&#39;t read it in so long that I don&#39;t even know if I would still enjoy it. One of the only things I //do// remember about this was that I spent a lot of time reording the addenda/emails and that it had two pretty substantial rewrites (for example, 5590 used to be able to communicate by writing things down on paper).

[[div class=&#34;commentary&#34;]]
**[[[ruiz-duchamp-ace-attorney|Ruiz Duchamp: Ace Attorney]]]**
* On July 12, 2021, [[*user Ralliston]] got drunk and wrote [[[A Broken Bookshelf]]]. From this event came what I call &#34;The Ralliston Challenge:&#34; Drunk write one Cool War 2 article. I&#39;m not much of a drinker, but I just to happened to have 4 wisdom teeth that needed removing. Since I was going to be put under, there was going to be a period where I was inebriated enough to take the Ralliston Challenge. What I quickly learned is that I&#39;m equal parts lazy and incapable when I&#39;m on anesthetics. By sifting through Discord logs and my own memory, I&#39;ve compiled a list of weird things I did:
# Had to have Ralliston fetch me a link to the Cool War 2 hub instead of looking for it myself.
# Writing the entire article like an interview log(the css formatting came later) because I couldn&#39;t be assed to write dialogue tags.
# Putting the CSS module about 1/5 of the way down the page with a comment saying &#34;hehe I put the module in the middle I&#39;m so devilish&#34;
# The origin of Duchamp&#39;s crystal is supposed to be a reference to the Wanderer&#39;s Library [[[http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/last-light-hub|Last Light Canon]]]. However, I didn&#39;t know the name of the island in Last Light. Instead of looking it up, I just... made up a name. I still don&#39;t know the name of that island, but I will forever call it Tarkan.
* One big difference between general anesthetics and alcohol is that I sobered up midway through my first day of writing. I was running out of steam and considered leaving the draft to rot, but people (mostly Ralliston (sorry Greebo)) pushed me to keep writing it. If you couldn&#39;t tell already, Ralliston is the main reason this exists, and I would like to entitle him to 30% of this article&#39;s upvotes[[footnote]]In all seriousness, ignore my authorpage will and give this one to him if I ever disappear from the site[[/footnote]]. After [[*user gremlingroup]] got me in touch with Ace Attorney aficionado [[*user ghostchibi]] and I did some more writing, I ended up with a tale that was about 3x longer and way more high effort than I had expected. And now I&#39;m legitimately proud of what was supposed to be a drunk-but-not-actually-drunk shitpost.

* The story behind this is exactly as unremarkable as you&#39;d expect. I got the idea a few days after getting my wisdom teeth removed. I considered making it longer, but I realized that expanding the joke wouldn&#39;t make it any funnier.
* When it comes to these sorts of quick jokey articles that tend to draw lots of traffic, there seems to be a tendency of authors coming to resent their article&#39;s success. They&#39;ve worked so much harder to write better articles, yet none of them surpass the rating of the low-effort joke. I&#39;ve come to terms with the idea that Pain is probably going to be my highest rated WL article. While I like to think that I won&#39;t come to hate that success, only time will tell. 

**[[[http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/the-advent-of-space-toad |The Advent of Space Toad]]]**
* This started out as a draft for the [http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/scavenger-hunt-contest Wanderer&#39;s Library Scavenger Hunt Contest], which is their equivalent of JamCon. While my initial draft had something, I wanted to spend more time on it and make it something better. I held off on posting it, rewrote a significant portion of it, and left it in a sandbox for a few months to work on other things. I eventually came back to it and... well I guess that&#39;s obvious.
* The hardest part of this was finding the balance between the serious sections and the comedic sections. If done well, the juxtaposition should make the funny parts funnier and the serious parts serious-er. If done poorly, both fall flat. The advice I got from [[*user GremlinGroup]] was to cut the jokes that felt like they were trying to be jokes. For example, the underlined section in this sentence was removed: &#34;Hourly aftershocks, looters in ruined cities, survivors inevitably turning on each other __and suggesting that maybe humans were the //real// monsters all along__, the usual.&#34;

Comments are really valuable (especially yours, dear reader), so I made a ListPages module that helps me find new comments.
[[module ListPages created_by=&#34;AnActualCrow&#34; category=&#34;*&#34; order=&#34;commented_at&#34; separate=&#34;no&#34;]]

If I can&#39;t be contacted for over 1.5 years, I want all of my co-authored articles to go to their respective co-authors and all remaining articles to be split between [[*user Dysadron]] and [[*user Uncle Nicolini]].
