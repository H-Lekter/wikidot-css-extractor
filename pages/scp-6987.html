    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>**Item #:** SCP-6987

**Object Class:** Neutralized

**Date of termination**: █/██/████

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6987-1 is to be contained in a standard humanoid cell with a 1 meter thick concrete reinforcement surrounding all sides. All audio equipment is to be voided from the cell at all times and SCP-6987 is to be put under 16 hour video surveillance (7am-11pm) and can be monitored by staff of any clearance level so long as they are approved to do so by a staff member of level 3 clearance or higher.

 SCP-6987-2 is to be contained in a spherical cell made of a composition of Bismuth and Ceramic coated in a white paint. Surveillance cameras are strictly forbidden and entry to the cell must be approved by a staff member of level 4 clearance or higher. Audio recording is to be turned on unless given direct approval from ███-██████.

In case of a containment breach SCP-6987-2 is to be returned to SCP-6897-1 and SCP-6897-1 is to be escorted from the building by a minimum of 3 on site facility guards, where it will be transferred to an arriving MTF team who will take it to the nearest safe location. In the case of SCP-6897-1 going rogue, orders are given to shoot on sight.

**Description:** SCP-6987-1 is a seemingly regular Male apart from being noticeably lanky. It is approximately 5&#39;10 and 145lbs (65kg) and is a pale Caucasian Male and is described to have medium length dirty blond hair and a roman nose. It was noted to be wearing a khakis and pink hoodie that had a ███████ ████ inscribed on it upon capture. SCP-6987-1 refers to itself as &#34;Luke&#34; and has displayed a distrust for on site staff upon questioning about this. SCP-6987-1 shows the ability to persuade anything it&#39;s tested on. It will use this ability to persuade it&#39;s victim into glaring into SCP-6987-2.

During a test that was given the direct approval from the ██ ██████ SCP-6987-1 was put to sleep with anesthetics, and cut open procedurally, where he was then found to not have any internal organs. His organs instead replaced by a black sludge substance that was later revealed to be composed of pig excrement, blood contaminated with Yersinia pestis, and human tissue. 

SCP-6987-2 Is a non sentient small black sphere, approximately 6 inches in diameter and 19.25 inches in circumference. SCP-6987-2 was retrieved alongside SCP-6987-1 from a house party in ██████████, ██████. SCP-6987-2 is seemingly an astringent sphere of gas that has the anomalous property of swallowing the sentience of anyone who gazes at it for a period longer than 2 seconds. 

Upon contact the human hand of one D-Class personnel was promptly eroded away. Upon testing in an attempt to figure out what the gas was composed of, It was found that the ball gave off static electricity, a new finding for the researchers.
