**Item #:** SCP-6677
**Object Class:** Euclid
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6677-1 and SCP-6677-2 are both to be contained in an 8 m x 8 m containment cell. The cell is to have an airtight door to avoid any possible shadows forming between the door and the door frame. The cell is also to be lit up at all times, and when any lights are having issues, the backup lights are to be activated while SCP-6677-1 and SCP-6677-2 are to be sedated before the main lights will be replaced or repaired. The containment cell is to have two beds built into the floor, as to avoid any shadows under the bed for either of them to hide in. SCP-6677 seem to be calmed down with bright lights, and can be directed places by guiding them with bright lights on their left, right and behind them, also preventing them from hiding in the nearby shadows.
**Description:** SCP-6677 appears to be a set of two beings, one looks to be male while the other looks to be female. The two share the same anomalous features and it is very possible there could be SCP-6677-3, but from the two contained, they seem to have the abilities to become shadows and to hide and move amongst shadows, making them almost undetectable while hiding.
SCP-6677 were first discovered by the foundation in an abandoned house, built around 1910, in 201█. The house was in [REDACTED], New York, and seemed to be a family’s home with pictures all over the place of a woman, a man and a little boy. The silhouettes casted by these pictures seem to line up with SCP-6677-1 and SCP-6677-2, but the three individuals in those pictures have not been able to be identified yet.
SCP-6677-1 seems to appear as a 1.77-meter-tall silhouette of a man, from close analysis of the anomaly’s face, their traits seem to change in subtle ways such as the nose changing size or the eyes being a little smaller, but they usually don’t change too much. The anomaly also seems to be able to change what it appears to be wearing, though it is very difficult to tell from observations. One of the main traits that doesn’t change is the anomaly seems to always have short hair.
SCP-6677-2 seems to appear as a 1.67-meter-tall silhouette of a woman, just like with SCP-6677-1, her face seems to change its traits, but this time also seemingly having jewelry on. The anomaly seems to be capable of changing what they appear to be wearing, since some researchers described her in a long dress, while others didn’t see any signs of a dress on her. One of the main traits that doesn’t seem to change is that the anomaly seems to always have shoulder length hair.
SCP-6677 seem to both be safe to be around most of the times, but they can become agitated and here are the observed ways they have been agitated in tests. The anomalies both seem to dislike any form of physical contact and will lash out at any, even if unintentional. The anomalies also seem to both dislike direct eye contact, if eye contact is maintained for more than five minutes then the two will become stressed and will become unpredictable, usually either lashing out or trying to create some distance between them and their observer.
SCP-6677 have only had one incident since being contained, where they had gotten out of their cells. SCP-6677-2 had managed to slip under the door before it was changed to an airtight door, causing her to be loose in the facility. She had been loose for 37 minutes in Site-██, then a newer guard had encountered the anomaly, SCP-6677-2 had been subdued by a standard stun gun, where after that she was able to be contained again, alongside SCP-6677-1 and there were to be more guards stationed until the containment cell had been updated to prevent another incident.
SCP-6677 seems to be unable to talk, or at the very least unwilling to talk during interviews to find out information on the anomalies, though guards passing by have reported they can faintly hear two voices talking in there.</textarea></pre>
