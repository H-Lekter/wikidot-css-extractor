**Item #:** - SCP 6649

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6649 must be kept in a 7 x 7 x 5 metre cell located in the humanoid containment facility at all times. As it contains a spirit, the entrance to the cell must be locked, and armed with an EMF reader at all times. Due to it’s ability to appear invisible, there must be at least three infrared cameras on the entity at all times.

Personnel must enter the cell wearing infrared sight glasses, or looking through an infrared camera. If entry to the cell is commenced, the door must be locked immediately. The cell door must be opened by people with a Level 3 keycard or higher.

The entity must also be under supervision when near a body of water. For example, a burst water pipe. If so, maintain it at a distance of four to five metres. If it should come in contact with the water, it must be contained immediately. It reacts largely with water, causing heavy rust, and aggressive behaviour, hence the class.

**Description:** SCP-6649 appears to be a cast iron suit of armour, with a cylindrical headwear. It is 2.6 metres tall and weighs 276 kilograms. It also wields a steel longsword, approximately 1.4 metres long. The weapon includes Gaelic text embossed into the blade and is also known as SCP-6649-1. SCP-6649’s original colour is a navy blue, but its chromatic spectrum is at random. At times, it appears invisible to the naked eye, and to any camera, although, infrared cameras are able to see a slight silhouette. Upon entry to the cell, it has been reported that sight is ceased.

SCP-6649’s headwear includes three respiratory cavities, and two eye cutouts in the shape of semicircles. The entity’s weapon is a luminous blue colour, but changes corresponding to the armour. It has a luminescent purple sphere where the blade and the grip cross. This is likely plasma. The armour’s spirit is able to produce audio, and is often showing signs of grief, extreme depression or other forms of suffering. Further logs describe this. 

SCP-6649 is able to use a variety of different sights, such as thermal vision, ultraviolet vision and infrared vision. The origins of these abilities are unknown, but it could correlate to the location it was found in. It was found in the Scottish village of Baile Clogaid, or Helmsville. 

SCP-6649 was discovered on this date; 16-3-1997 in a minute body of water, approximately 9.6 meters in diameter, producing large amounts of steam, and suffering from extreme metal corrosion and rust. Following restoration in the laboratory, it was discovered that it is carbon dated to 1657 AD. It was also discovered within 4 kilometres of a volcano, and itt is presumed that this is the cause of the stone buildup on the subject’s armour.

&gt; 
&gt; **[A low wail can be heard from the cell]**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. [REDACTED]:** Ok, we want to know where you’re from, is that all right?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-XXXX:** ……I…suppose…

&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. [REDACTED]:** Hello?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-XXXX:** …yes…
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. [REDACTED]:** Ok, thank you. Were you once human?
&gt; 
&gt; **[SCP-XXXX is silent for another 16 seconds, then thuds are heard from in the cell, followed by a scream.]**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. [REDACTED]:** Are you okay in there? Wait, something’s dripping into it’s cell. It looks like water.
&gt; 
&gt; **[A hissing sound is heard.]**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. [REDACTED]:** Is everything okay in there?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-XXXX:** …water…help…[inaudible]…
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. [REDACTED]:** Get some people in there, clear up the water.
&gt; 
&gt; **[Footsteps are heard.]**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. [REDACTED]:** What’s that? You can’t see? Take some cameras in.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-XXXX:** …thank…you…but…I still touched it…
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. [REDACTED]: Ok, are there severe conditions to that?
&gt; 
&gt; **[A deafening scream is heard then a lot of muffled banging is heard in the background.]**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. [REDACTED]:** Shut the door!
&gt; 
&gt; **[EMF reader beeping goes off.]**
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6649:** I…can’t…control this…i’m sorry…
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement** SCP-6649 was contained immediately after, and observed by 6 staff members. It became less aggressive after 11 minutes, though caution was still needed.
