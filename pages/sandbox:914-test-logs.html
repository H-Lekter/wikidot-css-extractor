&gt; Note: This page will be purged every week. If your log is rejected or doesn&#39;t adhere to the correct format, make sure to save a copy yourself if you want to try again.

Guidelines for future entries can be found [[[scp-914-experiment-log-guidelines|here.]]]

**Note to all contributors:**

Please include your name on all records, along with the date and the total number of items &#34;refined.&#34;

&gt; **Test Log Format:**
&gt; All test logs should be written in this form:

REMINDERS TO CONTRIBUTORS: SCP-914 does not create or destroy matter, nor does it change anything on the atomic level. All outputs should contain all and only the matter included in the input. Some grandfathered entries break this rule, but new entries should never do so.

**Additional reminder: 914 is a cheeky little bugger. It&#39;s unpredictable and apparently kinda snarky. If the output is exactly what you&#39;d expect from the input, or if 914 has just obligingly improved everything you put in, the entry is out-of-character.**

* [[*user Leveritas]] (me) will regularly check this page, selecting logs that are of sufficient quality to add to the log and port them over.
* Tests that fail to adhere to the proper format (date, etc.) will **not** be ported until fixed.
* You can place notes at the end of tests, and feel free to be creative when doing so. It can give some interesting insight into dynamics within the Foundation. Having said that, don&#39;t make Foundation personnel look like idiots/psychopaths/juvenile/a combination of those. It&#39;s a professional research organization, not a fraternity ward or a death cult.
* Not too direct. 914 doesn&#39;t talk to researchers directly, it ruins the mystery and it&#39;s not clear if the machine is sentient or not. If you put in a note, you don&#39;t get a response, you might get something that might be a response if you interpret it a certain way, but it also might be random. Or something else entirely.
* Ownership of content posted to the 914 log is retained by log curators as stewards over any content therein. As such, any authors contributing to the logs cede any future claims to said content to the collaboration log curator.

+++++ If you&#39;re not comfortable with your in-universe name being used, politely request a change or come to me about it. 

**Notice: On another note, changing these notices will result in disciplinary actions, meaning Site banning, not just this log.** 

Some of you might have noticed that I&#39;m being harsher on notes and logs that I deem too LOLFoundation. To illustrate my point, I&#39;m going to use an example from part IV:

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Half-Life 3?&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]

**Name:** Jr. Researcher Redmar 
**Date:** 20/03/2019
**Total Items:** One CD containing “Half Life” for PC

**Input:** Mentioned above
**Setting:** Very Fine 
**Output:** An extremely bright light consisting of [REDACTED] Lumens, which faded after 15 seconds, revealing a CD with the cover art resembling that of Half Life 2, but the 2 was replaced with 3. When inserted into a disk drive, an image with the word: “NOPE” appeared on screen, followed by a noise resembling human laughter.

//Note: Jr. Researcher Redmar has requested reassignment. Granted. - Dr. Veritas//

[[/collapsible]]

I actually edited the note. This is what it originally was:

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Half Life 3? Original&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]

**Name:** Jr. Researcher Redmar 
**Date:** 20/03/2019
**Total Items:** 1 CD containing “Half Life 2” for PC

**Input:** Mentioned above 
**Setting:** Very Fine 
**Output:** An extremely bright light consisting of [REDACTED] Lumens, which faded after 15 seconds, revealing a CD with the cover art resembling that of Half Life 2, but the 2 was replaced with 3. When inserted into a disk drive, an image with the word: “NOPE” appeared on screen, followed by a noise resembling human laughter.

//Note: Fuck you, 914 - Jr. Researcher Redmar// 

[[/collapsible]]

This is a very small difference, but it makes a world of difference in tone. The first entry works a lot better because it&#39;s not a researcher scolding the machine outright as a kid would. It&#39;s **implying** (read, show don&#39;t tell) that the researcher became so fed up with the result that he outright left. Wacky entries work well if it&#39;s against the cold professionalism that signifies the Foundation, and it **doesn&#39;t work** if it looks like the employees are acting just as unprofessional.

++ General Notes

+++++ Notices for everyone.

1. If you didn&#39;t bother reading the above division of obviously important text, click [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-914-experiment-log-guidelines here]!
2. Mod will remove notes if they are too excessive/LOLFoundation/unprofessional.
3. Part XVIII is up and running! Find your tests [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/experiment-log-914/offset/17 here].
4. New log-writers, **please do not use other writers&#39; characters without asking**. It is generally seen as bad form. If you want to use someone&#39;s character, most of the writers can be contacted via Wikidot PM or, for a quicker response, [[[https://discord.gg/UPXXUJmFYc | the 914 Discord server]]].
5. Everyone is invited to join the above Discord server. This also facilitates easier communication with the mod. If you notice something wrong with a particular test in Experiment Log 914, you can either point it out in the server or do so below.
6. //Please//, no more introduction notes. 914 is supposed to be unpredictable, and there’s only so many times it can turn handwriting into different handwriting or a drawing before you start predicting it.

++ New Entries 

----------------------------

**Name:** Dr. Thoreau
 **Date:** 2/9/2021
 **Total Items:** One copper padlock, a zinc pinball from the break room, one notecard, and two teaspoons of synthetic ink (poured onto the ground of the input booth).

//Note: I want to try something. - Dr. Thoreau//

**Input:** Above items
 **Setting:** Fine
 **Output:** A spherical brass padlock with twenty input keys, and a notecard with an eighteen letter combination on it along with the message &#34;ball locked&#34;. Dr. Thoreau proceeded to brute force the final two digits, eventually unlocking the padlock. Placed in Non-Anomalous storage.

//Note: For anyone wondering, the code&#39;s ████████████████████. Not what I expected, but ball has been unlocked. - Dr. Thoreau//

**Fix the (date) formatting, spell out numbers, lose the unnecessary comments and clear up what&#39;s actually being created here. &#39;&#39;Notecard with the words &#34;ball locked&#34; on it.&#39;&#39; What does that mean? Is it written with something? With what exactly? What happened to the pinball parts? - Mod**

//Look up what &#34;ball locked&#34; means in reference to pinball machines. Otherwise, revisions have been made. (To clarify, a pinball is the ball in the pinball machine, but you should probably have figured that out by now.) -Thoreau//

**You still haven&#39;t fixed the date formatting. We use DD/MM/YYYY, make sure there is a space between your total items and the note and between your output and your note. - Deb** 

//Fixed. -Thoreau//

**Date format still wrong. DD/MM/YYYY not D/M/YYYY. -Deb**

**&#34;Look up what &#34;ball locked&#34; means in reference to pinball machines&#34; Okay, no. That isn&#39;t going to fly. Not a lot of readers are going to know the intricate vocabulary of pinball, so this is going to go straight over their heads. You can&#39;t just tell the reader to Google everything. This information has to be conveyed in the test somehow, usually through a note, so readers can understand it without having to open a new tab to figure out what you meant. - Boneka**

------

**Name:** Researcher Carlson
**Date:** 09/02/2021
**Total Items:** 4 copies of Spooky&#39;s Jumpscare Mansion (&#34;OG&#34; version, no DLCs included)

**Input:** SJM copy
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** A 1.0 version of Spooky house of jumpscares

**Input:** SJM copy
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A copy of IMSCARED (sic)

**Input:** SJM copy
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Spooky&#39;s jumpscare mansion (&#34;HD renovation&#34; version)

**Input:** SJM copy
**Setting:** Very fine
**Output:** [Test aborted]
//Note: I feel like it&#39;s only going to go downhill from here, I think I&#39;m going to stop while I&#39;m ahead.//

----

**Name:** Dr. Matthews
**Date:** 04/09/2021
**Total Items:** An Xbox console with two controllers
**Input:** One Xbox console with two controllers
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One Xbox console with minimalistic graphics and speed. The controllers functions are inverted however, which renders the devices “unplayable” in some cases. Some games were observed to run extremely slower than others.

//Note: How am I supposed to play Red Dead Redemption with this thing? ~ Dr. Matthews//
