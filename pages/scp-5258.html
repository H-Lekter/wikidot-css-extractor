**SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:** 
SCP-5258 is to be stored within a 2m by 2m by 3m humidity controlled containment chamber. No doors possessing a peephole[[footnote]]{{**Peephole:** Also commonly known as a; Peekhole; Spyhole; Doorhole; Magic Mirror or Door Viewer.}}[[/footnote]] are to be present in wing //D-4// within the facility. All doors have viewing windows as alternatives. All additionally retrieved instances are to be incinerated upon relocation. Infected individuals will be quarantined immediately, and subjected to mental assessments to determine eligibility of allocation to E-Class[[footnote]]{{**E-Class:** Refers to a provisional classification applied to field agents and containment personnel that have been exposed to potentially dangerous effects during the course of securing and establishing initial containment over a newly-designated anomalous object, entity, or phenomenon. Class E personnel are to be quarantined as soon as possible, monitored, and screened for potentially harmful changes in behavior, personality, or physiology, and may only return to duty after being fully debriefed and cleared by psychiatric and medical staff.}}[[/footnote]] personnel. 

Experiments involving the instance and E-class personnel are restricted to Researchers with level 3 clearance. Of the eight armed guards stationed to patrol Floor //-3// in Wing //D-4//, one is to accompany any individuals entering SCP-5258&#39;s containment chamber for the entire duration of any interaction. Researchers and guards entering the containment chamber are to be fitted with a pair of project SCRAMBLE[[footnote]]{{**SCRAMBLE:** Was a project specially designed by Dr.Dan, who has since been terminated. The goggles contain a chip designed to pick up certain facial features and then begin to scramble them.}}[[/footnote]] goggles to wear while within the chamber, so as to not inadvertently contract the effects of SCP-5258.
----------------------------------------------------
**DESCRIPTION:** 
SCP-5258 is a series of doors which have anomalous effects localized on their peepholes. Effects of SCP-5258 are designated SCP-5258-1 and manifest as a series of visual and auditory occurrences. SCP-5258-1 occurrences happen at random intervals of time, with four occurrences transpiring per twenty-four hour long period. Occurrences initiate with an undeterminable noise, produced from the exterior of the instance. Effects of the instance become contracted by an individual making direct eye contact with the SCP-5258&#39;s peephole for a duration of 3 seconds. Individuals who have contracted the effects of SCP-5258 are affected indefinitely, unless the original affecting instance is completely destroyed, or the individual is terminated. While it is currently unknown how, project SCRAMBLE goggles provide a means of shielding one&#39;s self from contracting the effects of SCP-5258.

The entity SCP-5258-2 inhabits an alternate plane of existence through the peephole of SCP-5258. SCP-5258-2 inacts nearly all recorded occurrences of SCP-5258-1 that transpire within SCP-5258 instances. SCP-5258-2 resembles a humanoid in appearance, however, the entity stands approximately 2.4m in height and possesses a yet to be identified, opaque, dripping substance, coating it&#39;s exterior. SCP-5258-2 possesses; grossly elongated arms; seven elongated digits on each hand; hollow cavities in place of it&#39;s eyes and mouth; massive black boots encompassing feet that are notably grossly disproportionate to the entities legs; and what appears to be the lower half of a navy blue jumpsuit, devoid of any discernable markings or brandings. 

SCP-5258 will temporarily adapt in an attempt to redisperse it&#39;s effects to create new instances in alternative means, if left incapable of enacting it&#39;s anomalous effects for undeterminably prolonged periods of time. Adaptations have included; the transmission from hosts via direct physical contact upon expiration of the individual; the ability for hosts to infect uninfected doors from their exterior; instantaneous effects; spreading to an unaffected door (so long as it&#39;s within an unobscured view of the instance or a range of 10m if view is obstructed); and [REDACTED].

&gt; {{**&#34;The First Interaction With SCP-5258.&#34;**}}
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------
&gt; {{On 199■/07/14, foundation staff were alerted to the first ever instance of 
&gt; SCP-5258, located at the ■■■■■ ■■■■■ hotel in ■■■■■■■, Ontario, Canada. Undercover mobile task force agents situated in the area (performing tests on [REDACTED]) became alerted to the instance when police radio interceptions involving two frantic individuals (who had fallen victim to SCP-5258&#39;s effects), were reported by implanted foundation personnel in the region. 
&gt; 
&gt; Canadian mobile task force Cancer-1 (&#34;Immortal Crabs&#34;) sent over Squad-ᚢ[[footnote]]{{&#34;**//Ūruz//**&#34; is the reconstructed Proto-Germanic name of the &#34;//u//&#34;-rune. Represented in Elder Futhark by a &#34;//ᚢ//&#34;.}}[[/footnote]] to investigate and contain the instance of SCP-5258, amnesticize all hotel staff and occupants of the hotel and relocate infected individuals to Site-92. Before amnesticization was performed, Cancer-1 were informed by hotel employees that the room containing SCP-5258 had been previously inhabited by two seemingly normal individuals prior to this incident, and that after roughly a year of residency, there had been no such complaints by the former tenants. Those individuals who had been exposed to SCP-5258 (not simply the scenes of panic that transpired within the hotel) were unable to be cured via amnesticization and therefore had to undergo mental evaluations. Those individuals deemed to be mentally unstable following the incident had to be terminated, whereas those who were deemed mentally stable, were provided an option between termination or foundation recruitment as E-Class personnel. 
&gt; 
&gt; Once unaffected hotel staff and residents were migrated to another hotel, under the guise that there had been a sudden bedbug Outbreak within the hotel, Cancer-1 personnel quarantined off the building and took possession of every door located within the hotel. Upon relocation of the individuals, the initial instance and the entirety of the door (frame included) to Site-92, SCP-5258 was stored in a standard containment cell. The individuals have been placed in a containment suite measuring approximately 9m by 9m by 3.6m, directly adjacent to the newly appointed SCP-5258&#39;s containment cell. While technically the E-Class subjects are completely unaffected while away from SCP-5258, the foundation &#34;//encourages//&#34; them to each enter no less than four times each day, for no less than one hour each time, in hopes of recording any new occurrences and preventing SCP-5258 from gaining the desire to adapt and transfer in a new method. Should 14 hours transpire between an affected subjects last occurrence, they are to remain in the containment cell until such time as the subject experiences an occurrence. 
&gt; 
&gt; *Additionally, Class E personnel are required to take turns keeping the instance adequately cleaned, as there is no sense in risking exposure to others simply to perform such a medial task.}}

&gt; {{Log of --9-- 10 different (as of to date) observed SCP-5258-1 occurrences following the loud audible sound that initiates the occurrence to transpire. Occurrences are numbered by encounter as of the relocation and containment of SCP-5258.}} 
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------
&gt; {{**• NOTE:**}} {{Occurrences of SCP-5258-1 transpire at random. One E-Class personnel went on record claiming to have witnessed incident #■, 371 consecutive times.}}
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------
&gt; {{**1** - Someone the subject knows personally (a close friend or family member) will show up at the door (covered in what appears to be blood, sporting an array of open facial wounds) and repeat the sentence &#34;//please don&#39;t come out here, he&#39;ll kill you too!//&#34; multiple times, while crying and screaming at an audible volume, before continuing to walk out of sight to the left (limping in the process).}}
&gt; {{*This is seemingly the only occurrence that does not include the entity SCP-5258-2.}} 
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------
&gt; {{**2** - Similarly to the first occurrence, a close friend or family member) will show up at the door (covered in what appears to be blood and open facial wounds) however this time, they will not say anything (simply audibly crying and screaming). After approximately 10-15 seconds, the entity will appear. The entity will run up behind the victim and twist their head clean around on their shoulders. While the snap of the spinal cord is clearly audible, the victim won&#39;t cease to scream for approximately 10 additional seconds before falling lifelessly to the floor. Upon the completion of the aforementioned action, the entity slowly walks out of view to the right.}} 
&gt; {{*Quite frequently during this occurrence,}}
&gt; {{the entity will stare right at the subject.}} 
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------
&gt; {{**3** - This occurrence begins immediately (after the audible noise transpires) with what appears to be the panicked screams of a multitude of random individuals. Upon making visuals through the peephole of 
&gt; SCP-5258, subjects have reported viewing a crowd of people running from the right of view to the left (and then out of sight) from what inevitably reveals it&#39;s self to be SCP-5258-2 wielding a [REDACTED] and using it to [REDACTED] victims rapidly as it works it&#39;s way from right view to left and out of sight, leaving a trail of corpses in it&#39;s wake.}} 
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------
&gt; {{**4** - In this occurrence, the entity comes into view by slowly descending down a wall directly adjacent to SCP-5258 from the ceiling in a creeping manner. Should no wall be present close enough to the exterior of SCP-5258, the entity will hang from the ceiling/Sky by a sort of web-like string, coated in the same grey, translucent substance as the rest of the entity. Sporting a total of 6 arms (so as to have 8 appendages in total) the entity behaves in a way reminiscent of an arachnid, eventually waiting for a victim (a close friend or family member of the subject) to come into view from the right side of the peephole. The prey seems to have not noticed the entity perched on the wall (or dangling from the sky) until the moment that it&#39;s prey gets within striking distance (roughly 2.4 to 3.6m). At the moment the victim gets within striking distance, the entity lunges at them and takes hold with all 6 arms simultaneously. These occurrences end when the entity has finished devouring its prey, and at no point does the victim cease to scream until the point that the entirety of their being has been consumed (regardless of what point in time the head becomes consumed).}}  
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------
&gt; {{**5** - This occurrence begins with what appears to be a home invasion attempt. The subject will see what appears to be two very large individuals (sporting balaclava to mask their faces) standing near the exterior of the door speaking inaudibly amongst themselves for an undeterminable amount of time before appearing to prepare to smash it down. Just before either of the men can initiate the kick on the door (that the subject is watching through) the one who isn&#39;t initiating the kick rapidly swells and bursts open to reveal an instance of SCP-5258-2, who then proceeds to take a [Data Expunged] and [Data Expunged] the other man in mid kick (whose movements have slowed to a near halt), devouring the man afterwards while staring at the subject the entirety of the time.}} 
&gt; {{*Once the corpse has been fully devoured}} 
&gt; {{both the screaming of the man and the}} 
&gt; {{occurrence ceases abruptly.}} 
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------
&gt; {{**6** - In this occurrence, what audibly sounds like a young child, (approximately between the ages of 6 and 11) can be heard crying (has been recorded as both male and female vocals) from somewhere off to the right of view. Roughly 20 seconds later, the entity will emerge from the right side of view, clutching an unidentified child in it&#39;s arms while staring down at it. While the child screams and cries excessively, it does not appear to struggle, as if inflicted by muscular paralysis. Once the entity has averted it&#39;s gaze from the child towards the subject (this period of time ranges wildly), it then proceeds to [REDACTED] the child until the screams stop abruptly. The entity proceeds to [REDACTED] the child, and then sprints at the door until slamming into it with full force.}} 
&gt; {{*While this slam is audibly very loud to}} 
&gt; {{the subject, others in the room hear}} 
&gt; {{nothing. Additionally, the door does not}}
&gt; {{move as if being manipulated whatsoever.}} 
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------
&gt; {{**7** - In this occurrence, the entity will appear at the exterior of the door, dangling the severed head of the subject&#39;s close friend or family member in front of the peephole for them to see, while audibly laughing maniacally the duration of the occurrence.}}  
&gt;  {{*This occurrence seems to last indefinitely}}  
&gt; {{or until eye contact is broken with the peephole and the subject has left the vicinity entirely.}} 
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------
&gt; {{**8** - This occurrence shows the subject themselves standing at the doors interior, looking through the peephole, with 
&gt; the entity standing directly behind the subjects shoulder (the peephole seeming to act like a mirror) then the entity will proceed to take a [REDACTED] and use it to [REDACTED] the subject, resulting in the subject seemingly dying on the spot. Medical analysis shows the death to consistently be linked to heart failure, nothing else abnormal is observed. Other personnel in the room have reported to see nothing out of the ordinary leading up to the instant the subject falls lifelessly to the floor.}} 
&gt;  {{*This seems to be one of the only ways}} 
&gt; {{SCP-5258 has shown to cause any physical}} 
&gt; {{damage to a subject.}}  
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------
&gt; {{**9** - During this occurrence, it would seem that the entity is pressing it&#39;s eyehole up against the peephole and very slowly knocking (once per 10 seconds). After a duration of 5 minutes, the entity rapidly ducks down out of sight for good.}}  
&gt;  {{*It is only presumed that this entity is}}
&gt; {{the same as SCP-5258-2, as they share the}} 
&gt; {{same empty cavity eyeholes and opaque,}}
&gt; {{dripping skin}}

&gt; {{• **1. 199■/07/16.**}}
&gt; {{**Occurence: #7**.}}
&gt; {{**Test:** Researchers had E-Class personnel wait for an instance of SCP-5258-3 to occur, they then had the E-Class open the door  approximately 160° and step through the doorframe.}}
&gt; {{**Results:** Occurrence continued to play out undeterred. Entering the doorframe did nothing. E-Class reports that visually the scene was unaltered with the movement of the door, they claimed to get no new view of the scene at hand. It is also noted by the subject that opening the door did not increase the volume of the occurrance either.}}
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------
&gt; {{• **2. 199■/07/22.**}}
&gt; {{**Occurrence: #2**.}}
&gt; {{**Test:** Researchers had a blind D-Class subject enter the containment cell to see if a subject needed vision to become affected.}}
&gt; {{**Results:** After a total elapsed time of 24 hours, the subject reported no audible noises whatsoever. It would appear vision is necessary to be affected by the instance.}}
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------
&gt; {{• **3. 199■/07/24.**}}
&gt; {{**Occurrence: #N/A**.}}
&gt; {{**Test:** Researchers decided to attempt sending a D-Class member of staff into the containment cell while wearing a leftover pair of project SCRAMBLE goggles to see if it would have any effect when viewing 
&gt; SCP-5258. While most present researchers didn&#39;t believe the goggles would do any good, seeing as how they were designed to work with facial features. However, the director insisted and testing went on as planned.}} 
&gt; {{**Results:** We were surprised to learn that this test was successful and the SCRAMBLE goggles actually worked. While it is still not understood why the goggles work, --it has been speculated that perhaps the peephole somehow represents the face of SCP-5258-2--.}} 
&gt; {{• It has been noted that the goggles will, 
&gt; from this date on, be used as a means to 
&gt; assist with containment and research of the entity. Additionally, Dr.Templar is not to use personnel to perform dangerous tests with no scientific premise to back up his theories, no matter how expendable said personnel may be, as per instructions by the 05 council.}}
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------
&gt; {{• **4. 199■/02/21.**}}
&gt; {{**Occurrence: #7**.}}
&gt; {{**Test:** Researchers had E-Class subject tested what happens through the exterior of the peephole, once the occurrance had began. Subject was given a regular commercial brand reverse peephole viewer.}}
&gt; {{**Results:** Once the occurrence began, E-Class subject was asked to proceed around to the exterior and use the reverse peephole viewer on the door. Unfortunately, this test provided no new information, as assumed, nothing anomalous was visible through the peepholes exterior.}}
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------
&gt; {{• **5. 200■/08/14.**}}
&gt; {{**Occurrence: #4**.}}
&gt; {{**Test:** Researchers were curious what would happen if two E-Class subjects affected by the same instance were to simultaneously view the occurrence, if it would manifest separate occurrences for each subject. Subjects were provided with a standard pair of binoculars heavily modified to have the two eye lenses replaced with a single telescope lense which contained a glass prism transfixed within it so as to refract the light of the image through both eyepieces, this way both eyepieces will display identical imagery.}} 
&gt; {{**Results:** While the modified binoculars worked exactly as planned,  the two subjects reported identical occurrences. Experiment was performed eight times over the timespan of 48 hours, E-Class subjects reported sharing identical experiences during every occurrence.}}
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------
&gt; {{• **6. 201■/09/16.**}}
&gt; {{**Occurrence: #1**.}}
&gt; {{**Test:** Researchers attempted to see what would happen if they were to cut a small square portion out of the door (around the peephole) measuring 30.48cm².}}
&gt; {{**Results:** The E-Class subject sat in containment with SCP-5258 (and the removed peephole section) and after a while reported that the occurrence transpired as normal, however, the visual aspect of the occurrence was reportedly only visible through the peephole on the removed section, theoretically allowing a subject to move around SCP-5258 with them.}}
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------
&gt; {{• **7. 201■/09/17.**}}
&gt; {{**Occurrence: #7**.}}
&gt; {{**Test:** Researchers had E-Class personnel take the small square of SCP-5258 from Test #6 (containing the peephole) and bring it out of the containment cell and into a new (empty aside from a chair and a desk) room to see what would happen when the peephole section was relocated away from it&#39;s door.}}
&gt; {{**Results:** E-Class reports that after a while they could audibly still hear the loud noise from the other side of the small door section laying flat on the desk, upon picking up the section and viewing through the peephole, occurrence transpired as normal. It is additionally noted that 
&gt; E-Class reports that they are, in fact, able to move around with the section on door and it continues to display the occurrence as normal. Following this test the door was repaired with Polyurethane Glue and continued to work as normal.}}
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------
&gt; {{• **8. 201■/10/31.**}}
&gt; {{**Occurrence: #10**.}}
&gt; {{**Test:** Researchers attempted to see what would happen if they were to cut a larger square portion out of the door (around the peephole again). This time the square measured 60.96cm² (double the previous test).}}
&gt; {{**Results:** Following the loud noise, E-Class personnel reported not being able to see the occurrence through the peephole. 
&gt; E-Class personnel was then instructed to approach SCP-5258 and attempt to open it. When the subject approached the door, they were seemingly grabbed by their face (as they made no noise) and forcefully pulled, head first, through the hole in SCP-5258. *As of 202■/■■/■■ the E-Class personnel has not been recovered and has been officially listed as deceased. Following this test the door was repaired with Polyurethane glue and continued to work as normal.}}
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------
&gt; {{• **9. 202■/04/27.**}}
&gt; {{**Occurrence: #9**.}}
&gt; {{**Test:** Researchers attempted to see what would happen if they were to have an 
&gt; E-Class subject smash the peephole with a standard hammer mid-way through the occurrance.}}
&gt; {{**Results:** Upon smashing the peephole with the hammer, the subject reported hearing a horrifying screech that subsequently caused a migraine in the subject. Upon peering back through the hole in the door directly afterwards, the subject stated the previously viewed eye, that was directly adjacent to the peephole, was no longer present.}}
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------
&gt; {{• **10. 202■/04/28.**}}
&gt; {{**Occurrence: #8**.}}
&gt; {{**Test:** Researchers replaced the peephole in SCP-5258 with a completely different model of peephole, then had an E-Class subject wait to see if the instance still possessed it&#39;s anomalous properties.}}
&gt; {{**Results:** The Subject reported that the banging noise still occurred. Upon peering through the peephole the subject, within several seconds, let out a scream of terror and proceeded to collapse to the floor (later confirmed to be deceased). Upon autopsy of the subject, foundation medical experts found a stunning lack of abnormalities in the cadaver, it would appear that the subject simply died of cardiac arrest.}}
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------
&gt; {{**NOTE:** As of 202■/05/■■, storage of additional instances has become an unnecessary expenditure of resources. Therefore, it has been decided by the director that attempts at safe neutralization of the additional instances are to be enacted, so as to prevent the need of storing unnecessary instances on site.}}
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------
&gt; {{• **11. 202■/03/04.**}}
&gt; {{**Occurrence: #N/A**.}}
&gt; {{**Test:** Researchers proposed attempting to 
&gt; eliminate the anomaly by inserting it into a woodchipper.}}
&gt; {{**Results:** Proposition has been denied on the grounds of transpiring events that followed a particular notable incident involving the [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/goc-hub-page GOC] putting [[[SCP-1609]]] through a woodchipper. Alternative methods of neutralization will be attempted.}}
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------
&gt; {{• **12. 202■/06/14.**}}
&gt; {{**Occurrence: #NA.**}}
&gt; {{**Test:** Researchers propose attempting to eliminate the anomaly by inserting it into an incinerator.}}
&gt; {{**Results:** Sucessful. Oddly, while the entirety of the instance was reduced to ashes, the glass peephole remained unscathed by the flames. However, upon reapplication of the aforementioned peephole into a new door, the anomalous effects appear to have subsided indefinitely. Therefore, it has been concluded that incineration is a viable means of disposal of additional SCP-5258 instances.}}

&gt; **Interviewed:** E-387 (Jerry) &amp; E-388 (Diana).
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr.Templar.
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** *The Following Is a transcript of a video Log between Dr.Templar and the two newly designated 
&gt; class E personnel, &#34;//E-387//&#34; and &#34;//E-388//&#34; (previously known as &#34;//Jerry//&#34; and &#34;//Diana//&#34;) following the events that transpired on 14/07/199■, that have been transcribed in 
&gt; &#34;Addendum: DDC-5258/H-1&#34;.
----------------------------------------------------
&gt;
{{*The doctor enters the interview room and takes a seat across the table from a larger man with a big bushy mustache and a tall, yet slender, woman. Dr.Templar takes out his notes, opens them casually, and proceeds to inact the interview.}} 
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log, [199■/07/14 - 23:58]&gt;** 
&gt; 
&gt; **• Dr.Templar:** //Hello Mr. and Mrs. ■■■■■, we..//
&gt; **• E-387:** //What the he&#39;ll do you people want with me and my wife?!// 
{{*The man jumps up out of his seat as he screams.}}
&gt; **• E-388:** //Jerry, shut the fuck up, and let the government guy talk!// 
{{*The man slumps back into his seat.}}
&gt; **• E-387:** //yes ma&#39;am.. sorry sir, how can we help you?//
&gt; **• Dr.Templar:** //we got a report that you saw something abnormal through the peephole of your hotel room this evening, is this correct?//
&gt; **• E-387:** //Abnormal?! That&#39;s the understatement of the fucking century!//
{{*The man once more jumps out of his seat}}
&gt; **• E-388:** //Holy shit Jerry, if I have to tell you one more time..// 
{{*A scowl now visible across her face, the man proceeds to once more collapse back into his chair, befallen across his face now appears a look of mild defeat.}}
&gt; **• E-387:** //Sorry Diana.. yes sir, we saw something &#34;abnormal&#34; all right!// 
&gt; **• Dr.Templar:** //Then please sir, describe what you saw exactly.//
&gt; **• E-387:** //Okay.. well first, me and my wife were getting ready for bed, when all of a sudden, we hear this loud-ass bang just outside our room..// 
{{*The doctor, seemingly unperturbed, scrawls down a few more notes.}}
&gt; **• Dr.Templar:** //Do go on..//
&gt; **• E-387:** //Well, obviously I jumped the hell out of bed to see what the fucking racket was, and my wife follow up behind me... I told her to back up and looked through the peephole..// 
&gt; **• Dr.Templar:** //What precisely did you witness through the peephole sir?//
&gt; **• E-387:** //There were these two huge guys in ski masks, I couldn&#39;t figure out what that loud-ass noise was, but they were just standing out there.. looked like they were talking to each other but I couldn&#39;t hear them..//
{{*The doctor appears to finish jotting down another note and looks up at the man.}}
&gt; **• Dr.Templar:** //What next?//
&gt; **• E-387:** //I went to grab my gun. I&#39;m not a dumbass, I&#39;ve stayed in some shady hotels before.. when I turned back around my wife was looking through the peephole, I quietly whispered to back the fuck up while I loaded my pistol.//
{{*Dr.Templar appears to take a note and proceed to turn and face the woman.}}
&gt; **• Dr.Templar:** //And Mrs.■■■■■, did you see the two men as well?//
&gt; **• E-388:** //Yes, not for too long, usually I wear the pants in this relationship, but when it comes to my protection.. Jerry is always the one to step up hard, so when he said to move, I listened and backed all the way up and stood in the doorframe of the bathroom in there, just in case I had to duck in there last second.//
&gt; **• Dr.Templar:** //I see..//
{{*Dr.Templar once again takes some notes before turning back to the man.}}
&gt; **• Dr.Templar:** //And Mr.■■■■■, upon returning to the door, what happened next?//
&gt; **• E-387:** //It was fucked man.. I was holding my gun up, looking through the peephole to see if it was even our room these guys were coming at, and then I see the guy on the left take a couple steps straight towards our door and wind up to kick it in.. then shit got real man...// 
{{*The man begins to nervously twitch at the dest.}}
&gt; **• Dr.Templar:** //Please do go on sir.//
&gt; **• E-387:** //Before the one guy could kick in our door, it was like shit suddenly went kinda slow-motion for that guy, but in normal speed the guy on the right suddenly started to swell up like a fucking balloon.. then he just.. popped, this weird-ass monster thing came out of his body, moving way too fast and shit, then the freaky thing pulled out this fucking [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] the 1st guy, then he started to fucking eat him! Guy was screaming like crazy, fucked up part too is the thing started by eating the guy&#39;s head, and when he was like, half way through the guys body, I noticed that I could still hear the fucking guy screaming.. not a clue how the hell that shit worked.. but anyway, freaky fuck wouldn&#39;t stop staring at me while he was doing it.. then when he was done, it all went silent fast.. Then the thing just kinda walked off..//
{{*The man, having worked himself up while describing the details of the event, found himself back out of his seat. This time however, he noticed this fact and lowered himself back into his chair, staring anxiously now at his wife.}}
&gt; **• E-387:** //Jerry, come on, you don&#39;t have to be so vulgar with the guy..//
{{*Notable shame envelopes the man&#39;s face for having allowed himself to get so worked up.}}
&gt; **• Dr.Templar:** //It&#39;s perfectly understandable ma&#39;am, you two have been through quite the ordeal tonight. I believe that&#39;s all the information I need, we&#39;re going to get you a room here for the night, completely free of charge.//
&gt; **• E-387:** //That&#39;s awesome man, thanks!//
{{*The man stands and forcefully takes the doctor by the hand for a handshake, clasping both hands around the doctor&#39;s in the process.}}
&gt; **• Dr.Templar:** //It&#39;s not a problem at all sir, sleep well.//
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log, [199■/07/15 - 00:06]&gt;** 
&gt; 
{{*As the two leave the room, Dr.Templar appears to express a look of shame of his own. Well aware of the fact that the subjects are imprinted by the entity, on more than simply a mental level, nothing could realistically be done for the two.}}
----------------------------------------------------
&gt; *Following this interview, Dr.Templar had agents inform the two individuals that they would become permanent residents of Site-92 now (this was met with mild hostility from E-387). Once E-387 could be calmed down, the two were informed of their new status as E-Class personnel and provided with a brief summary of the foundation and Site-92.

----------------------------------------------------
&gt; **Interviewed:** Coroner, Stephen ■■■■.
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr.Templar.
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** *The Following Is a transcript of a video Log between Dr.Templar and the Site-92 coroner, &#34;//Stephen ■■■■//&#34; (henceforth, reassigned as &#34;//E-2123//&#34;) following an event that transpired on 23/03/202■ where the coroner in question, inadvertently initiated another spread of SCP-5258 by accidentally becoming infected and leaving Site-92.
----------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
{{*Dr.Templar is seated, in an interrogation room. Directly adjacent to him sits a tall, stocky man, cuffed to the table by his wrists. He proceeds to shuffle around some paperwork on the desk between them both, then proceeds to commence with the interview.}}
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log, [202■/03/24 - 14:30]&gt;** 
&gt; 
&gt; **• Dr.Templar:** //So... Stephen ■■■■, would you be so kind as to inform us how exactly you managed to carry the SCP-5258 infection out of the facility, and precisely why?//
&gt; **• E-2123:** //Oh, come on doc! There&#39;s no way you guys seriously think I did all this on purpose!//
{{*The man rattles his handcuffs in an ill-fated attempt at standing abruptly in a fit of rage.}}
&gt; **• Dr.Templar:** //Please refrain yourself, then tell me Stephen, what exactly happened that led us to this unpleasant turn of events?//
{{*The man readjusts himself in his seat and proceeds to recall what he knows to the doctor, who is now taking notes.}}
&gt; **• E-2123:** //It&#39;s like I said doc, I don&#39;t have a clue... One day, you guys are having me examine the remains of that one E-Class guy who you&#39;ve been getting to test that door, you know, the one with the anomalous Peephole we keep locked up in containment. Then later that evening, I guess my daughter&#39;s friend came by and knocked on my door, thinking nothing of it I went and looked through the peephole for a couple few seconds, just to be sure of who it was. Then way later that night, I was getting ready to lay down for bed, when there was this loud smashing sound at my front door... God I wish I hadn&#39;t looked..// 
{{*A sullen expression washes over the man&#39;s face.}}
&gt; **• Dr.Templar:** //And tell me Stephen, what exactly did you see through the peephole?// 
&gt; **• E-2123:**//It was horrible.. It looked like my daughter was outside, I could see her face.. but it just didn&#39;t make sense.. I knew for a fact that she was upstairs in her bedroom. She had just recently called down to me to ask for some water on my way up to my own bedroom.. but then.. oh God..oh God...// 
{{*The man proceeds to anxiously attempt once more, to stand. However, this time, the man seems to be moreso in a state of retreat from his own words.}}
&gt; **• Dr.Templar:** //Steven, if we&#39;re going to get through this, your going to have to let me know what happened after you saw your daughter through the peephole.. 
&gt; **• E-2123:** Okay.. well, she had this look of lifelessness on her face, which quickly began to make sense as she backed up... or should I say, HE backed up...// 
{{*The man now visibly showing a sense of fear, now slowly creeping across his face.}}
&gt; **• Dr.Templar:** //Yes, so you saw the entity 
&gt; SCP-5258-2, so you are, in fact, infected.. so tell me, what did it do next?//
&gt; **• E-2123:** //When he backed up.. I could see he was holding my daughter&#39;s head by her hair... SHES ONLY 8 GODDAMMIT!!!// 
{{*Fully aware now that attempts to stand were futile, the man proceeds to slam his fists down onto the table in a mixed state of rage and sorrow.}}
&gt; **• Dr.Templar:** //I said settle down Steven! Continue describing the event so we can both be done here...//
{{*After several moments to regain his composure, the main continues.}}
&gt; **• E-2123:** //...Remember when I said that lifelessness on her face quickly started to make sense?...//
&gt; **• Dr.Templar:** //Yes Stephen, do continue.//
&gt; **• E-2123:** //...It&#39;s because she WAS lifeless...// 
&gt; **• Dr.Templar:** //Elaborate please, it was assumed she was most likely deceased, as per the way SCP-5258-3 situations always tend to transpire. We need to know what he did to her..//
&gt; **• E-2123:** //HE KILLED HER!// 
{{*Streams of tears now pouring from the man&#39;s eyes.}}
&gt; **• Dr.Templar:** //Stephen, for the last time, calm down!  I&#39;m sure a man of your professionalism is perfectly aware that your daughter was fine in the end, she didn&#39;t actually die.//
&gt; **• E-2123:** //Ya, but, isn&#39;t she going to get some weird effect now or something?//
&gt; **• Dr.Templar:** //That&#39;s not how this entity works, had you read it&#39;s file you would know that.. as long as you didn&#39;t see yourself, whoever was in the instance of 
&gt; SCP-5258-3 you saw, will never suffer any negative effects, your daughter will be just fine. In fact, had you not panicked the way you did, she would have never been any the wiser.//
{{*Tears subsiding, the man perplexity continues.}} 
&gt; **• E-2123:** //What was I supposed to do doc? That thing had my daughter&#39;s decapitated head, just dangling by her hair, in his hand..// 
{{*A look of vague amusement momentarily passes across the doctor&#39;s face.}}
&gt; **• Dr.Templar:** //Oh, just Situation #7.. super common instance of SCP-5258-3.// 
{{*At this, all tension seems to relieve in the man.}}
&gt; **• E-2123:** //Oh... well that&#39;s a huge relief doc! I can&#39;t wait to get back home and let my daughter know everything&#39;s good and I just had some kind of nervous breakdown from the stress of work or something like that.. Ha! And here I was genuinely worried for a bit there doc!//
{{*The doctor&#39;s expression suddenly drops.}}
&gt; **• Dr.Templar:** //Well... actually Stephen.. you&#39;ve been exposed to SCP-5258.. you can&#39;t go back home.. ever..//
{{*Now the man appears to express a hint of fear and anxiety.}}
&gt; **• E-2123:** //But doc! What the fuck are you talking about?! I have to get home, my daughter and wife are going to be thinking, God knows what, about all of this until I can explain this shit to them!// 
&gt; **• Dr.Templar:** //I&#39;m afraid that simply isn&#39;t an option Stephen.. you should know perfectly well by now how the foundation operates..//
&gt; **• E-2123:** //But... doc...//
&gt; **• Dr.Templar:** //I&#39;m sorry to be the bearer of this terrible news Stephen.//
{{*The man begins to silently sob.}}
&gt; **• E-2123:** //..........//
{{*After quite some time of chilling silence the doctor goes on.}}
&gt; **• Dr.Templar:** //You can at least take some solace in knowing I personally wrote the letter that the foundation sent to your family..//
&gt; **• E-2123:** //What did it say doc?..//
&gt; **• Dr.Templar:** //I had it state that you were a secretive member of the CIA, who met his unfortunate demise while in the process of successfully thwarting a terrorist operation centered around assassinating the president. It stated that this is the reason you were never able to indulge your true profession to them, and it ended by stating that you earned a medal of honor, I forge a pretty good look-alike if I do say so myself, and hey, look on the bright side..//
{{*Having expressed an upturn of emotion upon hearing the contents of the letter to his family, the man seemed slightly amused at the doctors last words.}}
&gt; **• E-2123:** //There&#39;s a bright side doc?// 
&gt; **• Dr.Templar:** //Oh, heavens yes! Typically, someone in your unfortunate situation, would be either Immediately terminated, or terminated right after we found out what we needed to know, so essentially, right after I walk out of that door. However, I have pretty high authority in the foundation as the director of Site-92. Therefore, I was able to pull a couple strings and have you reassigned, as opposed to terminated!//
{{*The doctor now seemingly fairly pleased with himself.}}
&gt; **• E-2123:** //Wow.. actually, thanks doc.. why do that for me though?// 
&gt; **• Dr.Templar:** //You&#39;ve been working for me for about 3 years now, before you, no one could hold that position for more than a couple weeks.. we have a lot of spreadable instances here at Site-92 as I&#39;m sure your aware.. the fact you took this long to make a mistake as simple as forgetting to read a file thoroughly enough, tells me I hired the right guy.. and now, this is my way of showing my appreciation.// 
&gt; **• E-2123:** //That&#39;s actually amazing doc.. thank you so much for that! I actually feel pretty honored! But I have to ask.. you said reassigned.. so I&#39;m not a coroner here anymore?//
{{*A look of Confusion sweeps over the man now.}}
&gt; **• Dr.Templar:** //Sadly, not anymore.. instead you will be assisting me with the SCP-5258 tests from now on.//
&gt; **• E-2123:** //You mean with those other two?// 
&gt; **• Dr.Templar:** //Yes, you will all share a domicile with them, adjacent to the containment cell of SCP-5258.//
{{*The man&#39;s expression shifting back to vague sorrow, with a hint of acceptance this time.}}
&gt; **• E-2123:** //So now I&#39;m an infected test subject.. some reassignment..//
&gt; **• Dr.Templar:** //Try to think of it this way Stephen, one, your not getting terminated.. that alone is a huge bright side, your family believes you died a hero, protecting the freedom of the nation.. you get to stay here for free and do next to nothing instead of working all day, isn&#39;t that all positive?//
&gt; **• E-2123:** //Ya.. thanks doc.. it&#39;s just.. I&#39;m going to miss my family..//
&gt; **• Dr.Templar:** //We can be like your family here Steven, if you&#39;ll let us. You&#39;ll find that not everyone gets the exception of becoming a permanent E-Class, so the ones that do, are like part of the foundation family.. atleast that rings true for Site-92// 
&gt; **• E-2123:** //Atleast I already know everyone here for the most part.. I guess it won&#39;t be that bad.. thanks again doc, your pretty amazing.//
{{*At this compliment, the doctor smiles at the man.}}
&gt; **• Dr.Templar:** //Well I do try Stephen, and I&#39;m so glad I could convince you this is for the best, otherwise, they were going to terminate you regardless of my intervention.. fortunately, that won&#39;t be necessary.. 
&gt; E-2123.//
{{*Seemingly taken aback by the doctor&#39;s smile, given his circumstance, and suddenly being referred to as E-2123 the man continues.}}
&gt; **• E-2123:** //You know, you can still call me by my real name doc..//
{{*Realizing he referred to the man by his E classification, the doctor&#39;s smile immediately fades from his face, becoming replaced with a look of sincere remorse.}}
&gt; **• Dr.Templar:** //Unfortunately Stephen, while I will be doing so in person and off the record, I must refer to you in the documentation as E-2123, calling you by it aloud as opposed to simply writing it was a complete slip of the mind..//
&gt; **• E-2123:** //Just call me E-2123 then, eh doc?..//
{{*The man&#39;s head drops down and he stares blankly at the table.}}
&gt; **• E-2123:** //As if this is my life now...//
&gt; **• Dr.Templar:** //Sorry again Stephen..//
&gt; **• E-2123:** //yeah.. so am I doc..//
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log, [202■/03/25 - 14:46]&gt;** 
&gt; 
{{*As Dr.Templar turns to exits the room, he peers once more over his shoulder at the man, who is once again uncontrollably sobbing, and proceeds to exit the interrogation room.}}
&gt;

&gt; *Following this interview, it was deduced and noted by Dr.Templar that the infection can migrate hosts if the 
&gt; affected subject ceases to live. Currently it is unknown exactly how the infection transfers between human hosts, however, it is definitively known that the only way it can do so is through physical contact once the initial subject has become fully deceased.

{{Quite an eventful day. A new case, followed by an interesting interview. On a side note, Site-92 received a new batch of D-Class personnel. I know there convicts, but if 
D-1692 continues to act so rudely, I have no problem putting him on some more difficult cases.}}

D-1692 should have never been transferred to my site, he&#39;s a despicable human being.}}

While I have not been given disciplinary action, the council has stated I&#39;m now on their radar. I will find out who went over my head and they will be reprimanded.}}

{{After a few years, a researcher came to me with a new proposal for SCP-5258. It involved specially modifying some binoculars to test two subjects at once. I approved the experiment, it sounds interesting, and even if it doesn&#39;t work out, I&#39;m sure we can find a way to make use of it on some other experiments at another time.}}

{{Retrieval of E-387 has proven unsuccessful, despite Cancer-1 specialists being within the confines of SCP-5258&#39;s alternate dimension for a week now. With reports of no signs of E-387 within the dimension, I had to make the tough call to have Cancer-1 specialists return to Site-92. I have decided that so long as we continue to store the instance of SCP-5258, there may be a chance E-387 could find a way back to our dimension on his own. Therefore, I will postpone declaring E-387 deceased for the time being.}}
