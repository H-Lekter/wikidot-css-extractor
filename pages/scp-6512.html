**Item #:** SCP-6512

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** All individuals infected with SCP-6512 are to be terminated, unless otherwise specified by operatives with Level 5 security clearance or higher. Corpses of terminated individuals are to be sprayed with an extremely toxic substance, such as hydrogen cyanide, to exterminate any instances of SCP-6512-1. Any infected individuals that are not terminated are to be kept in 10m x 10m holding cells lined with copper and equipped with basic necessities at Site-6512. Access to Site-6512 and the area around the site requires at least Level-4 security clearance and a full-body hazardous material suit lined with copper. Any corrosion on the walls of SCP-6512 holding cells are to be reported to site administration immediately.

**Description:** SCP-6512 is a highly infectious disease, the knowledge of which is to be kept top secret. The SCP-6512 pathogen shares characteristics of non-anomalous viral, bacterial, and protozoan diseases, but does not fit specifically into of these categories. Classification as a living organism is pending.

SCP-6512 is spread by a small airborne insect similar in appearance to a dragonfly, designated SCP-6512-1. SCP-6512-1 appears to be living in mutual symbiosis with the SCP-6512 pathogen, with the pathogen providing habitation in return for a new host. Due to the swiftness of infection and development of the disease, with a supply of new hosts the number of instances of SCP-6512-1 increases dramatically, with several hundred thousand currently in containment and possibly billions in the wilderness. SCP-6512-1 are capable of secreting an extremely corrosive substance, capable of corroding through most materials with ease. Copper appears to be resistant to this substance, hence the choice of SCP-6512&#39;s current containment cells.

SCP-6512 infects a host upon contact with SCP-6512-1. Infection is 100% certain in all recorded cases, with symptoms manifesting up to 12 hours after infection.

* Approximately 12 hours after infection, the infected individual will report persistent skin irritation.
* Approximately 24 hours after infection, holes will begin to open up all over the infected individual&#39;s body. These openings are initially about 1mm wide, but will expand over the next 48 hours, causing extreme discomfort and panic in the infected individual.
* Approximately 72 hours after infection the openings in the infected individual&#39;s body will stop expanding in width and begin to expand in depth, initially about 1mm deep.
* Over the next 48 hours the openings will continue to expand in depth, eventually connecting with other openings and forming a network of tunnels inside the infected individual. It is to be noted that no blood is lost throughout this process. Upon completion of the tunnel network, instances of SCP-6512-1 will crawl inside the tunnels and begin to reproduce, effectively making the infected individual a walking nest.
* Approximately two weeks after initial infection, instances of SCP-6512-1 will leave the infected individual in search of another host, leaving the individual to die, usually due to lack of blood flow to vital organs.

Â A cure has not been found for SCP-6512 yet.
