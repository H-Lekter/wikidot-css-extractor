**Item #:** SCP-6234

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Any non-foundation owned airplanes, helicopters, or ships that come within 600 kilometers of SCP-6234 are to be radioed by foundation staff from Site-87 (a foundation site which is located on the north-eastern side of SCP-6234 with the sole purpose of the site being to study and contain SCP-6234), and directed to change course as to make sure that SCP-6234 is not accidentally discovered by non-foundation personnel. If a radioed vehicle does not change it&#39;s course immediately, foundation security personnel are authorized to take a more forceful approach to ensure that SCP-6234 is not discovered. 

There are five humanoid instances which seem to have abruptly manifested on SCP-6234 some time ago, judging by what the instances have told on-Site personnel during interviews with the instances. These instances that reside on SCP-6234 (labelled SCP-6234 instances 1-5 respectively), are to be kept on SCP-6234 at all times. Although these instances are allowed to roam about SCP-6234 freely, Standard issue surveillance cameras have been placed around SCP-6234 to ensure that none of the SCP-6234 instances(s) have left, or are attempting to leave,SCP-6234. 

In the case of one of more SCP-6234 instances leaving or attempting to leave SCP-6234, security personnel residing in Site-87 are to, by any means deemed necessary, capture and/or prevent any SCP-6234 instances from leaving SCP-6234. It is worth noting that while all SCP-6234 instances are allowed to go into the water surrounding SCP-6234, the foundation will consider it an escape attempt if the instance(s) are to travel a minimum of 100ft away from SCP-6234 in any direction. 

If any SCP-6234 instance(s) have attempted to escape SCP-6234, personnel from the on-Site location of Site87, are to hold the SCP-XXXX instance(s) that have attempted to escape once the instance(s) have been recaptured, and bring them in for questioning. Once questioning is completed, the SCP-6234 instance(s) are to be returned back to the main part of SCP-6234 where they are again able to wander around SCP-6234 freely.

**Description:** SCP-6234 is a tropical island with a size ranging approximately 32 miles from the island&#39;s northern end to it&#39;s southern end. SCP-6234 is located in the ███████ Ocean at the coordinates ██, ███, ██.

The island, though mainly consisting of plant life and rain forests, also has many stone mountains as well as beaches with sand that surround the entirety of the island&#39;s perimeter. The island also sports man made structures, presumably made by the SCP-6234 1-5 instance(s), though this theory remains unproven. The structures on the island are mainly large areas of paved cement that are located at numerous points throughout the island, houses as well as other smaller shelters that have various belongings in them such as food, weaponry such as guns, bullets, and knives, both male and female clothing, flashlights, books, and a vintage TV set, which SCP-6234-5 is commonly seen using to view hunting documentaries and airsoft sports on, as well as a few other items of no significant importance.

SCP-6234 hosts five humanoid instances who reside on it. Each of the five instances all have their own distinct physical features, personalities, attire, and occupations (These features, personalities, attire, and occupations have been described in detail down below). It has been observed, however, that each of the occupations that SCP-6234 instances 1-5 have all seem to relate to assassination in one way or another. Despite this, all instances of SCP-6234 are physically incapable of inflicting lethal harm on anyone, with minor stab and bullet wounds being the most severe type of harm that the instances have even been able to inflict.

It has been observed by on-Site personnel that SCP-6234 instances 1-5 will frequently engage in team-based combat with one another in battles that take place at various places throughout the island. These battles usually include weapons like shotguns, pistols, axes, flamethrowers, grenades, knives, dynamite, sniper rifles. Although SCP-6234 instances 1-5 will always have the same occupation during a battle, the teams will frequently switch, causing which instances and the number of instances that are on a team to differ from battle to battle. Why these battles take place at all is unknown as of the current time.  

Despite taking place frequently, these battles always happen to end in a stalemate due to the fact that each of the instances on both teams are unable to land a lethal shot, resulting in both teams exhausting each other out until they are no longer able to fight.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Descriptions for SCP-6234 Instances 1-5&#34; hide=&#34;- Descriptions for SCP-6234 Instances 1-5&#34;]]
**SCP-6234-1:** SCP-6234-1 is a human male of Caucasian descent, about 28 years of age, and with a height of approximately 5&#39;2. SCP-6234-1 sports a red bandanna on his head, a white T-Shirt which has had it&#39;s sleeves ripped off to give the impression of a tank-top, and standard camouflage combat pants and combat boots. SCP-6234-1 seems to have the occupation of that of a ninja, or some other type of martial-arts style assassin, seeing as SCP-6234-1 has been observed to fight primarily with knives, and pistols, as well as occasionally engaging in physical combat. However,SCP-6234-1 is unable to land an attack of any kind on opponents, with the attacks that do land only resulting in minor physical damage. SCP-6234-1 has been described by on-Site personnel as having a moderately cooperative yet clumsy personality. SCP-6234-1 is typically the most compliant instance to the foundation out of the five, and has had the least amount of escape attempts from SCP-6234 out of the five as well.

**SCP-6234-2:** SCP-6234-2 is a human male of Caucasian descent, about 51 years of age, and with a height of approximately 5&#39;8. SCP-6234-2 sports a white tuxedo and tie, as well as white shoes, white gloves, and a white fedora. SCP-6234-2 seems to have the occupation of a sort of front line offensive/defensive soldier, either leading his team or providing cover for them during battles. SCP-6234-2 has been observed to fight with Tommy guns, Shotguns, and SMGs during battles, but, much like all the other SCP-6234 instances, is unable to lethally wound any of his opponents. SCP-6234-2 personality has been described by on Site personnel as having a &#34;Stereotypical Italian mob boss&#34; personality, complete with the instance having a thick, stereotypical Italian accent, as well as having stereotypical 1940&#39;s-50&#39;s era mob boss mannerisms.

**SCP-6234-3:** SCP-6234-3 is a human female of African descent, about 31 years of age, and with a height of approximately 5&#39;0. SCP-6234-3 sports a grey tank-top, dark red combat pants, black combat boots, and black fingerless gloves. SCP-6234-3 also has a black hair tie, which only is occasionally worn by the instance. It is worth noting that as a physical trait, SCP-6234-3 has facial freckles, and is the only one out of the five instances to have such a trait. SCP-6234-3 seems to have the occupation of that of a close-quarters assassin, using shotguns, pistols, revolvers, and explosives with a small maximum explosion range during battles. SCP-6234-3&#39;s personality has been described as &#34;go-lucky,&#34; as well as &#34;slightly stubborn&#34; by Site personnel. 

**SCP-6234-4:**SCP-6234-4 is a human female of Caucasian descent, about 38 years of age, and with a height of approximately 4&#39;8. SCP-6234-4 sports a white T-Shirt, grey combat pants, and black combat boots, as well as a black utility belt which holds a number of specialized gadgets thatSCP-6234-4 uses during battles. These gadgets include:

* A Taser, which SCP-6234-4 uses as both a weapon and to short circuit things such as electronic locks and defenses.
* A Tranquilizer Gun, which acts as SCP-6234-4&#39;s primary weapon during battles.
* A Handheld PDA device, which resembles a typical smartphone, but, unlike a typical smartphone, is able to construct sentry defenses in a matter of seconds.
* A Small Drone, capable of scouting enemy territory, and equipped with two rapid fire guns to use if the drone is spotted while scouting.

SCP-6234-4 seems to have the occupation of that of a spy, judging to the nature of the gadgets that SCP-6234-4 has. However, in contrast to the nature and mannerisms of typical spies, such as a government spy, SCP-6234-4 has a very arrogant and boastful personality, despite having no real reason to be either arrogant or boastful.

**SCP-6234-5:** SCP-6234-5 is a human male of unknown descent, about 41 years of age, and with a height of approximately 5&#39;4. SCP-6234-5 sports a rugged, stained grey trench coat, red shirt, and black pants and shoes, as well as a black bow tie. SCP-6234-5 also has a pair of thick, tinted aviator goggles which are over the instance&#39;s eyes at all times. It has been discovered that, despite wearing these goggles, SCP-6234-5 is completely blind, causing on-Site personnel to assume that SCP-6234-5 relies on hearing to help the instance navigate during battles. SCP-6234-5 seems to have the operation of an explosives expert, seeing as SCP-6234-5 uses grenades, dynamite, and small land mines during battles, as well as an AK-47 to use if need be. SCP-6234-5 has a blatantly insane personality, with the instance behaving disturbingly calm at one moment, only to act intensely frenzied the next. SCP-6234-5&#39;s insane behavior can also be observed in the way the instance speaks, with the instance speaking rapidly in a mixture of Spanish, English, and incoherent gibberish. It has been observed that SCP-6234-5 is not always present during battles, instead staying in one of the shelters built on the island, where the instance stands and stares at one of the shelter walls until the current battle is over, where the instance seems to realize that the battle is complete causing it to throw a short, yet sometimes violent tantrum, most likely because the instance has missed the battle.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Notable Interviews with SCP-6234 Instances 1-5&#34; hide=&#34;- Notable Interviews with SCP-6234 Instances 1-5&#34;]]
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Interviewed:** SCP-6234-1

**Interviewer:** Dr. █████

**Foreword:** SCP-6234-1 was brought in for questioning after both SCP-6234-3 and SCP-6234-1 were discovered to be formulating a plan for escaping SCP-6234.SCP-6234-5 was brought into the interview as well per the request of SCP-6234-1.

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**Dr. █████:** SCP-6234-1, would you please mind telling me exactly what that paper was that was found in both your and SCP-6234-3&#39;s possession?

**SCP-6234-1:** I&#39;m pretty sure you already know that, doc.

**Dr. █████:** Well, yes, but I need you to say what it is it for the record, alright?

**SCP-6234-1:** (Sighs) Alright. Yeah. Sure, doc. It was a paper with a written plan that both SCP-6234-3 and I were forming so we could try to escape the island.

**Dr. █████:** Thank you, SCP-6234-1. Now, may I ask why exactly you wanted to leave the island?

**SCP-6234-1:** I wanted to leave it because I&#39;m sick of this island, doc! I&#39;ve lived on this island my whole life! Now, don&#39;t get me wrong, the island&#39;s great, but I don&#39;t like it!

**Dr. █████:** So you wanted to leave the island because you don&#39;t like it?

**SCP-6234-1:** What?! No, doc! I love the island! It&#39;s a great island! It&#39;s my home! But all my life I&#39;ve been here! And I hate it, doc! I hate it so much!

**Dr. █████:** Uh, you&#39;ll have to forgive me, SCP-6234-1, but I&#39;m a little confused. You&#39;re saying that you like the island, but you&#39;re also saying that you don&#39;t like the island. Which one is it?

**SCP-6234-1:** I told you already, doc! Remember?

**Dr. █████:** I remember that you told me two very contradicting statements.

**SCP-6234-1:** Oh, for the love of-! Why the hell are we even talking about this, doc?!

**Dr. █████:** As I told you before, SCP-6234-1. It&#39;s for the record. Now would you please answer my question in a...less contradicting manner?

**SCP-6234-1:** My God, doc! I already answered your question! You asked &#39;why did you try to leave the island,&#39; and I said &#39;because I hate the island!&#39; But you don&#39;t gotta worry about me trying to escape again, doc. Because I love this island! I&#39;m perfectly happy on this island! Why the hell would I ever try to escape again when this island has all I could ever need?


**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Closing Statement:** The interview proceeded in the same way, with Dr. █████ asking SCP-6234-1 the same question, and SCP-6234-1 giving the same contradicting response every time. The interview was ended when Dr. █████ walked out of the interview room, frustrated with SCP-6234-1&#39;s contradictions. When the recording of the interview was uploaded onto the main on-Site computer, all the power on the entirety of the island went out for a short period of time. This power outage was most likely due toSCP-6234-1&#39;s contradicting statements overloading the system.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Interviewed:** SCP-6234-2, SCP-6234-4, and SCP-6234-5

**Interviewer:** Dr. █████

**Foreword:** SCP-6234 instances 2,4, and 5 were brought in for questioning shortly after one of the frequent battles that the five instances had against each other ended, with the intent of trying to understand the reason for the battles to take place.

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**Dr. █████:** SCP-6234 instances 2,4, and 5, we would like you to help us understand why you and the other instances take part in these battles you five frequently seem to have. Why do you have the battles? What is the reason for them?

**SCP-6234-4:** Even if there was a reason for our battles, why the hell would we tell you guys, the people who are keeping us hostage on this damn freaking island, anyway?!

**Dr. █████:** What do you mean by &#39;Even if there was a reason,&#39; exactly?

**SCP-6234-2:** Isn&#39;t it obvious, doc?! We just fight! We don&#39;t quite know why we do, but we just know that we have to!

**Dr. █████:** So you just fight each other for sport?

**SCP-6234-2:** No! We fight each other because it&#39;s our job to fight each other!

**Dr. █████:** I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t understand.

**SCP-6234-4:** All that we know, buddy, is that it&#39;s our job to fight and beat the hell outta each other. We don&#39;t really know why it is. Wish we did, but we don&#39;t. 

**Dr. █████:** Does that mean that someone hired you all to fight each other?

**SCP-6234-4:** Do-Don&#39;t know, doc. Don&#39;t-a know.

**Dr. █████:** My God, this is so confusing. Why are you all so damn confusing?!

**SCP-6234-4:** If we weren&#39;t confusing, we wouldn&#39;t be one of your SCP&#39;s or whatever the hell it is that you people call us.

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Closing Statement:** Interview proceeded and concluded with no new information as to the reasoning behind the battles that the instances engage in, other than the statements given by SCP-6234-2 and SCP-6234-4, which consisted of the information regarding the fact that none of the instances knowing why they fight, yet saying that it is their job to fight.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Interviewed:** SCP-6234-1,SCP-6234-3, and SCP-6234-5

**Interviewer:** Dr. Roddenburg

**Foreword:** SCP-6234-1, SCP-6234-3, and SCP-6234-5 were brought in for questioning following an incident that had happened during a battle that occurred earlier in the day.

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**Dr. Roddenburg:** I trust you three assholes know what this is about?!

**SCP-6234-3:** Woah! Looks like somebody woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning.

**Dr. Roddenburg:** (Ignoring SCP-6234-3&#39;s remark) Thanks to you three freaks, Dr. Holst is in the infirmary getting a bullet taken out of his right forearm!

**SCP-6234-1:** It was an accident, sir! Surely you must know that, right?!

**Dr. Roddenburg:** How can you accidentally shoot someone on the second floor of a building with a bullet from a shotgun when you are a half a mile away from them, facing in the opposite direction, and with a plastic window in place protecting the said someone?!

**SCP-6234-3:** I honestly don&#39;t know what&#39;s more impressive, doc. The fact that none of us can ever seem to land a killing shot, or that I was able to hit Dr. Holst somehow when I was aiming at instance 2.

**Dr. Roddenburg:** This is not an achievement that you should be proud of, SCP-6234-3! You harmed a foundation staff member! Accident or not, this is not something to be taken lightly!

**SCP-6234-3:** What do you mean &#39;accident or not&#39;?! I shouldn&#39;t have to face any consequences for something that was an accident! And it //was// an accident, doc! SCP-6234-5 was there when it happened! Tell him what happened, 5! Tell him it was an accident!

**SCP-6234-5:** //unintelligible gibberish.//

**Dr. Roddenburg:** I...Have no idea what that means.

**SCP-6234-3:** It means that I did-didn&#39;t mean to hit Dr. Holst in the forearm, doc! It was an accident! My aim needs to be worked on!

**&lt;End Log**

**Closing Statement:** The fact that SCP-6234-3 said she did not mean to hit Dr. Holst in the //forearm//, instead of just saying that she did not mean to hit Dr. Holst at all, poses some concern for on-Site staff. Because of this, SCP-6234-3 will be under more intense surveillance than the other SCP-6234 instances for the time being.

[[/div]][[/collapsible]]

**Addendum:** It is unknown as of the current time as to why SCP-6234 Instances 1-5 are unable to lethally harm anybody, or why the fights between the instances on SCP-6234 occur. Some personnel believe that it is one of the anomalous properties of SCP-6234 which cause the SCP-6234 instances to never lethally harm anybody, as well as the reason why the SCP-6234 instances engage in fights with each other for seemingly no reason at all. However, there has been no evidence to support this theory being true.</textarea></pre>
