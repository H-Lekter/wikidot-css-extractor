**Object Class: Euclid**

**Special Containment Procedures:**
SCP-6082 is to be kept under armed guard at all times. Personnel entering 6082 are to be debriefed and put into a special log. 

Procedure 519-Lima: 
One Class-D personnel is to enter 6082-1 every week. They are to remain in 6082-1 until [DATA REDACTED], at which point another Class-D personnel must go and close the doors from the inside. Said personnel must then be considered lost. 

**Description:**
SCP-6082 is a set of metal emergency exit double doors. When opened, SCP-6082-1, a pocket dimension around 6km² in area. SCP-6082-1 appears to be a labyrinth of hotel corridors, sprinkled with rooms. Said rooms appear to be in a state of decay, with previous tests suggesting a severe mould infection. There is no illumination in 6082-1, the hallways being in a state of perpetual darkness. 

Items such as dried fruit and water bottles can be found in the rooms lining 6082-1, as well as beds and chairs. The furniture is in disrepair, not having been used in over five decades. The dried fruit and water is safe to consume, with no anomalous effects having been recorded. 

Entities known as SCP-6082-A inhabit 6082-1. Although 6082-A has been nearly wiped out by Foundation expeditions, a small number still prowl 6082-1. 

6082-A resembles a 6’6 tall humanoid, with luminous eyes and pale, stretched out skin. It is incapable of speech, only vocalising canine growls and barks. 6082-A instances usually have hair, although said hair has been made out of canine fur. Instances are strong enough to break down wooden doors, and are capable of damaging 6082-1. 

When 6082-A instances spot a human, they will let out an ultrasonic pulse that alerts fellow instances nearby. It will then proceed to run on all fours towards the subject, and will [DATA EXPUNGED] the human if caught. 

6082-A has a rudimentary skeletal structure, though lacking a ribcage. The spinal cord and cranium are particularly durable, and the limbs seem be comprised of over 100 ligaments and bones. Although lacking muscles and tendons, 6082-A can run up to 29 kilometres per hour, although it does not run fast normally. Instances of 6082-A do have organs. The brain is in the cranium as expected, but is protected by a layer of cartilage. The nerves come out of the bottom of the skull and behind the throat, branching out into the body. 6082-A has four small lungs, One pair in front and one pair behind. The heart, which is 120% larger than that of a human’s, is at the centre. Instances do not appear to have a digestive system. 

6082-A instances do not require food, but seem to hunt on instinct. They only have a cavity below the mouth, which gradually fills up with the things they eat until the cavity is filled, at which point instances regurgitate the contents of their cavity and go off to hunt.

**Addendum 6082-1: Discovery**
6082 was found in ███████, Canada. Reports of mysterious disappearances reached the Foundation, and a short investigation was undertaken. 
SCP-6082 was located and secured by a foundation agent who had personally entered 6082. When found, the door was cut out of the wall and transported to Site-██. This had no effect on 6082-1. 

**Addendum 6082-2: Possible extensions**
6082-1 could be larger than expected. There were reports of an office area beyond 6082-1’s “hotel corridors”, but the team sent to investigate never returned. Thermal scans have indicated a large population of 6082-A infesting said area. It is suspected that there is another zone beyond the “office area”, with even higher quantities of 6082-A. Expeditions to eliminate 6082-A are to be called off until --firebombing is approved--. Denied, Site Command
