**Item #:** SCP-5139

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** The trajectory of SCP-5139 is to be calculated and reported to the Head Researcher of Site-77, 60 days before an occurrence of SCP-5139. The local media outlets are to be contacted, with the following performance of a cover operation, stating an EF5[[footnote]]A scale used for rating a tornado’s intensity[[/footnote]]-class tornado at the same coordinates as SCP-5139. A state of emergency is to be declared.

Following Incident-5139-1-A, the Special Containment Procedures were updated: multiple power units have been implemented to ensure the correct functionality of the Thanatos Servers[[footnote]]The servers which maintain the Headgears’ properties during missions[[/footnote]]: the position of each should only be disclosed to staff with clearance level 4 or higher. Upon entrance of unauthorized military forces in SCP-5139, MTF operatives should be informed and ordered to engage with lethal force against potential enemies.

--MTF Kilo-19, designated “Cat Eyes”-- MTF Mu-13 should be sent to the engaged position, once equipped with the Thanatos Headgear [[footnote]]Protective devices used by agents to protect themselves from generating an SCP-5139-1 instance [[/footnote]], with the major aim of terminating instances of SCP-5139-1. To establish safety, civilians involved should be sedated and later on injected with class B amnestic. Once the assigned task force has reached the extraction point, they are ordered the use of explosive devices to simulate a previous passage of an EF5 tornado: all deaths, not interesting Foundation staff, are to be ignored.

**Description:** SCP-5139 is a weather phenomenon with a 6km radius of effect, that occurs every 33 years between 3:00 am to 3:00 pm, on ██/██: SCP-5139&#39;s position depends on the movements of major air currents; however, due to the aforementioned property the location of the object can be established before its activation. No known means of detection exist at this time to perceive SCP-5139 while inactive; further research about these mechanisms is ongoing.

On ██/██, SCP-5139 will be perceptible in the form of fog: highly limited visibility was observed in the affected area; the view is evaluated lower than 30 m. The main anomalous effect of the object is the manifestation of a humanoid entity (designated SCP-5139-1), which appears when a sapient individual enters SCP-5139 without suitable protection. The SCP-5139-1 instances take the form of deceased relatives of humanoids subjects: SCP-5139-1 maintains the organs and the skeletal structure of an average human, with the exception of not being able to interact directly with organic substances, including other living creatures. [[footnote]] The subjects are still vulnerable to inorganic materials; the usage of projectiles was proven effective.[[/footnote]]

During SCP-5139&#39;s dormant phase, previously formed SCP-5139-1 instances are reported to still exist, making the object more difficult to contain and increasing the probability of leaks; consequently, they&#39;ve been designated Species of Interest-7383. If left to continue, the activity of SCP-5139 could potentially result in an SK-Class shift of dominance scenario. Relying on the gathered intelligence, the O5 Council voted unanimously to extinguish SoI-7383, due to the insufficient time-lapse available by the Foundation to execute the Special Containment Procedures correctly.
 
Tests conducted on-site of the previous event, revealed that SCP-5139 establishes contact with the subjects&#39; mind on the purpose of manifesting SCP-5139-1. Following this discovery, the Thanatos Headgear was developed to obstruct the above-mentioned telepathic effect.

**Addendum 5139.1 - Thanatos Headgear:** The Thanatos Headgear is an electronic device designed by the SCP Foundation, used to protect the operatives assigned to SCP-5139. The samples were implemented with data and devices act to benefit its occupants during the mission, such as Thermal Vision Goggles, detectors of movement, a list of local disappeared civilians, video feedback, and others. The access is to be permitted only to Personnel with Clearance level 4 or higher unless given prior authorization by Dr. D. Connor.

The Thanatos-Servers [http://www.scp-wiki.net/secure-facility-dossier-site-77 (Site-77)] are used to store data regarding SCP-5139, with the major task of maintaining the functionality of the headgears during missions. At the current time, the position of their generators is top secret.

**Addendum 5139.2 - Incident 5139-1-A:** On ██/██/201█, MTF Kilo-19 &#34;Cat Eyes&#34; was mobilized by Site-77&#39;s headquarters as per protocol. The video feedback of the headgears and the security cameras were turned off. From the witnesses gathered, the investigation team has determined that coordinated attacks were conducted simultaneously either to MTF Kilo-19 (under an assault launched by unknowns) either to Site-77 (Security Breach caused by Dr. Rossi in Sector-43); the incident resulted in 69 casualties. The Special Containment Procedures were updated with the intent of preventing the events described in the following documentation.

= **(AUDIO/VIDEO LOG) INTERVIEW 5139-1**
----
**INTERVIEWED:** Captain A. Kettler

**INTERVIEWER:** Dr. D. Connor

**FOREWORD:** At the return of MTF Kilo-19 (Cat Eyes), it was stated that only 4 of 14 agents were present; each of the survivors was in a confusional state. To reconstruct the dynamics, the agents were interrogated about the operation.

[BEGIN LOG]

//(The interview is taking place in a hangar)//

//(Two men are sitting one in front of the other. One of them has his head bowed. It seems that the subject has cried before being interviewed)//

**Dr. D. Connor:** I&#39;m sorry for everything you went through today. //(Pause)// Let&#39;s begin.

**Dr. D. Connor:** Here we are. Can you tell us how the mission started?

**Captain Aaron Kettler:** //(Clears his voice)// Sorry. Ah, shit //(Drinks. Pause)// Basing on the preliminary analysis, we all hoped to complete the mission within, dunno, maybe 8 hours? //(Sighs.)// We wore the headgear and went to the place. There was nobody there. Literally no one. The schematics were all good as well as the TVGs [[footnote]] Thermal Vision Goggle[[/footnote]] and all the other stuff. We had nothing to worry about. The task was easy and everything was going off without a hitch. We finished the checking of the first district in less than 2 hours, without even meeting anybody. To be honest, we were nothing but unprepared for what was going to happen.

**Dr. D. Connor:** Do you think that the team was logistically unprepared for the mission?

**Captain Aaron Ketter:** Why do you idiots have to misinterpret everything? We thought that it wasn&#39;t going to be that difficult, just that.

**Dr. D. Connor:** When you say difficult, you&#39;re referring to what happened to the team or to something else?

**Captain Aaron Kettler:** //(Pause)// Nothing.

//(Pause.)//

**Dr. D. Connor:** When did you meet the first civilians?

**Captain Aaron Kettler:** //(Sighs.)// So, basically //(Clears his throat)// Fuck.  It was the third quarter we inspected. The scanners began to ring. Y&#39;know, the red light which beeps. We turned around and the automatic detectors identified 2 possible instances: a woman called Sarah Walker, BBC reporter, and her kid Charles Micheals. The kid drowned in a pool last year and so the choice was easy. //(Pause)// The execution was carried out quickly. And //(Sighs)// that&#39;s it.
 
**Dr. D. Connor:** Do you remember what they said when they saw you?

**Captain Aaron Kettler:** //(Pause while looking at the interviewer with a reflex of anger)// I do. Why&#39;re you asking?

**Dr. D. Connor:** Would you mind describing the interaction in detail? And before telling me anything, just know that in this case, it is really important to understand the possible psyche of the people involved. So answer me, calmly.

//(The captain stares at the interviewer. His eyes are framed by dark circles.)//

**Captain Aaron Kettler:** Fuck off.

**Dr. D. Connor:** Do you want to respond or are you just looking for disciplinary actions? It can sound freakish but you have to answer. //(Pause)// I&#39;m sorry for both of your losses, and I know that you&#39;re the one who lost more during this Incident. But it&#39;s really important to respond if you want us to help you.

**Captain Aaron Kettler:**  //(Hesitates)// I hate my goddamn work. //(Sighs)// She said things like &#34;Here. We&#39;re here! Sweetie, they sent the military to the rescue.&#34;, &#34;We&#39;re safe.&#34;, &#34;Daddy&#39;s gonna be so happy when we&#39;ll get home.&#34;,  stuff like that.  The woman turned white when we started aiming at the child. You can guess the rest buddy... I&#39;m not gonna tell you.

**Dr. D. Connor:** I think that&#39;s enough.

//(Scrolling the papers)//

**Dr. D. Connor:** Cadet Milligan and Corporal Daniels. They died before the Thanatos Servers were deactivated. Would you tell us how?

**Captain Aaron Kettler:** //(Pause)// It happened right after the HQ contacted us. They told us that a security breach had occurred that they couldn&#39;t provide the use of the Headgears any longer and that we had to get our asses out of there; they previously placed a helicopter in case of emergency. I couldn&#39;t believe that Alber... I mean, Rossi caused all of this shit. We suddenly lost connection with Site-77 and.... we were surrounded. Well equipped soldiers armed with P90s. I think they eluded the scanners. There was a sort of symbol on their helmets, it was like a tree with a lizard on the bottom or something. They told us to surrender and they asked if we&#39;ve &#34;seen them yet&#34;. I don&#39;t know how they knew about the SCP-5139-1s. Someone pulled out a tranquilizer and pointed it at me... that&#39;s when the fight began. Milligan got a bullet in his head almost instantly. Daniels instead... he got shot in his leg. He was begging for help. He managed to crawl in my direction trying to take my hand. I almost got him when... //(Sighs)// Oh god... We got out of that hell just &#39;cause I managed to throw a grenade nearby a gas can. It was a stroke of luck, a miracle.

//(Pause.)//

**Dr. D. Connor:** How long did it take to reach the aircraft?

**Captain Aaron Kettler:** I think half an hour, but I&#39;m not sure. Even though the Headgear is equipped with an internal watch, I didn&#39;t pay attention to that. Time runs slower when you&#39;re leaving behind two friends.

//(Pause.)//

**Dr. D. Connor:** And could you tell us what happened when you spotted the SCP-5139-1s.

**Captain Aaron Kettler:** //(Pause.)// Fuck. //(His tone of voice subsides)//.

//(Pause.)//

**Dr. D. Connor:** Stay calm. Take a deep breath and go on.

**Captain Aaron Kettler:** //(Hesitates. The captain has shiny eyes)// When I first saw her I got my heart in my throat. She yelled my name. When I aimed at the instance almost immediately... she looked so confused. The others were in the same situation. Once we put the SCP-5139-1s against the wall //(Swallows)//, Amelia started crying. I was aiming at the head to make it quicker... in all the time I worked for the Foundation, I never missed a target, never, until this morning. I shoot her in the stomach. She fell on the ground screaming. I don&#39;t know how many cries I stifled in those few seconds. Her last word was &#34;Why&#34;. //(Sighs)//. Then I gave her the mercy killing... mercy... //(Quietly)// Shit. I fucking hate this... //(Tears begin pouring from the subject&#39;s eyes)// You don&#39;t know how it feels when you look at the eyes of a mother whose son died before her eyes while knowing that it is you that kill her child... you don&#39;t know how it feels when you killed someone you loved, especially when you drove them to... fuck... //(Pause. The subject recompose himself)// You know what the worst thing is? It feels like I destroyed something sacred, someone, that was gifted with a second chance. It&#39;s difficult to describe... I&#39;m sorry...

//(Pause.)//

**Dr. D. Connor:** Stay calm, it&#39;s almost over. We would like to know how the team mutinied; the dynamics.

**Captain Aaron Kettler:** ... When I was finished with her, I asked who was the next one. //(Swallows)// I don&#39;t know if you can tell but I wasn&#39;t in a good mood. No one responded. Then I took the first SCP-5139-1 I could and I pointed my gun at it. That&#39;s when someone started shooting. I got behind a car to stay safe from the bullets. It wasn&#39;t easy to kill my own comrades; many fell on the ground because of me... I bet someone drowned in his own blood. I got into the Mil Mi-27[[footnote]]A soviet helicopter[[/footnote]] by a miracle: I felt like I wasn&#39;t supposed to die yet, like  I was destined for something different... for a different death... //(Pause)// While I was flying away, I saw that the guys I left behind, the ones who were shooting, got encircled by armored vehicles. There was the same symbol present on the uniforms of the guys who attacked us before. I never felt so scared during my whole career, and the worst thing is that I don&#39;t have an explanation for this... maybe I don&#39;t want one either.

//(Pause.)//

**Dr. D. Connor:** Do you have any idea why the MTF Kilo-19 soldiers did what they did? They were prepared for the worst, and so we don&#39;t understand how everything turned out the way it did.

**Captain Aaron Kettler:** //(Pause.)// They had probably the same feeling as me.

**Dr. D. Connor:** I know it can be hard to terminate your own...

**Captain Aaron Kettler:** I&#39;m not talking about killing the 5139-1s... or not only that. It was something different. Something that felt wrong.

//(Pause.)//

**Dr. D. Connor:** Anyway, I think we&#39;re done here. You can leave now.

//(Captain Aaron Kettler gets up)//

**Dr. D. Connor:** Wait... there&#39;s one last thing I&#39;m supposed to show you. We found some emails and a note in Alberto Rossi&#39;s office. I think you should take a look at them. Afterall you two were close.

//(Pause.)//

**Captain Aaron Kettler:** Actually, after everything he did, I don&#39;t think that I wanna have anything to do with him, ever again. No, I don&#39;t wanna. It&#39;s better not.

**Dr. D. Connor:** Ok then. This concludes Interview 5139-1, about Incident 5139-1-A. This recording will be sent to the Administration; you&#39;re free to go.
-----

[END LOG]

**CLOSING STATEMENT:** This version has been confirmed upon other interviews. A class D amnestic was administered to all personnel involved. The recovery team sent on-site reported that both the SoI-7383&#39;s samples and agents of &#34;Cat Eyes&#34; were missing. Traces of heavily armed vehicles were stated to be in the vicinity of the Incident. On ██/██/201█, the body of captain Aaron Kettler was found in the bathroom of Storage Sector-22; the subject hanged himself, despite the amnestic therapy  proven to be effective.
[[/div]]


[[/collapsible]]
**Addendum 5139.3 - The Suspect:** Dr. Rossi’s corpse was found in generator Cell-85 (Thanatos Servers Power Supply); the suspect had committed suicide, despite the wounds caused by firearms at the torso and left arm, which, upon autopsy, were demonstrated to be too severe for Dr. Rossi to hang himself, implicating that the suspect had to sustain a significative amount of pain in the process. A hostile, unknown being was introduced in Sector-43 by the suspect using an unregistered briefcase. This event resulted in 59 casualties between staff members, which stopped once the entity was terminated by security personnel. The power supply of the Thanatos Servers and the HQ&#39;s one were found deactivated once the security was re-established.

Dr. Rossi&#39;s office was found in a heavily damaged state. A mix of tears and vomit was discovered on the room floor. Inspecting the office of Dr. Rossi, the investigation team found 37 messages within the email box of the suspect (designated Evidence 5139-01) sent by/addressed to an external profile that has not been tracked or identified yet; the attachments to the emails were deleted before being recovered. Additionally, note (designated Evidence 5139-02) was recovered  from the suspect&#39;s desk.

 While the securing of the SCP-5139&#39;s position, the rescue team found a handwritten document (designated Evidence 5139-03), dating back, according to the results of the carbon 14 test, to the empire of Tiberius, more precisely, between 29 AD and 34 AD. Evidence 5139-03 is written in Latin and upon analysis, multiple fingerprints of 3 different subjects were found, each not corresponding with the ones belonging to the MTF operatives. Despite the supposed age of the evidence, it was stated the presence of a footnote written in modern English.

If we&#39;ve contacted you correctly, you should be able to read this mail without us being tracked. You&#39;re probably asking who are we. I can&#39;t tell you much. We got our eyes on you for quite a long time, since she killed herself. I think we can free you from your guilt and from all the pain and the suffering you went through. You&#39;ll be contacted again tomorrow. Have a nice day.

I don&#39;t give a fuck about your next email. Mine will be sent to Gillespie [[footnote]] Site-77 director[[/footnote]]. I&#39;m sure she won&#39;t like this, and so it’s  better for you to stop pissing me off.

Relax. At the right moment, two squads will enter the perimeter, with the directives of sedating the subjects, securing the SCP-5139-1s, and bringing either the instances and the agents in a safe place. No one&#39;s gonna get hurt. You&#39;ll find the information you need attached to the mails.

I can&#39;t do that. You told me no one was going to get hurt. That thing is going to kill everyone in sector-43, just to give me the time I need to deactivate the generators? And then what?

Yes, you can. Someone needs to be sacrificed for the greater good. Your part is crucial. You have to interrupt the communication between Site-77 and the MTF, and then you have to make the headgears useless before any 5139-1 could get hurt. Is that way complicated?

//**To whoever finds this**//

Here we are. At the end of the tunnel. I&#39;m not sure of almost everything that happens these days. I&#39;m only sure of one thing. This is a suicide note. The last proof I ever existed.

I never felt so bad in my entire life: like a prisoner who just got sentenced to death, knowing that there&#39;s nothing that can save him now. I feel abandoned while surrounded by the crowd. Like if I&#39;m screaming and no one is noticing. I cannot complain, I haven&#39;t the right to. This is all my fault. I decided to lead myself down into the abyss. No one has to feel guilty about me, even tho I don&#39;t think someone will.

The executioner here isn&#39;t the Foundation nor me, but them. I don&#39;t know how and why they did that and why they want to do that. I don&#39;t know why there&#39;s a briefcase behind me and how it got here. The only thing I know is that they won&#39;t stop. When I wrote those emails I got the feeling that they were scared rather than angry. Like if the life of hundreds of persons depended on saving the 5139-1s. Who knows. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll check out my email box, and I&#39;m just telling you something that you&#39;ll figure out soon enough. I was manipulated excellently by someone whose goals are beyond my understanding. What a pathetic way to go down. I am pathetic, and if I die no-one will notice.

I want to dedicate my last words to you. I&#39;m sorry for leaving, we almost got through this. But the past called me and I had to answer. We have to save her. I shouldn&#39;t have cheated on my wife, and you shouldn&#39;t have betrayed your sister. We shouldn&#39;t have forced her to put a knot around her own throat. I remember finding her, knowing that we led her to a horrible ending. This is almost over; however, I know you&#39;ll save her. I know you won&#39;t let me die in vain. I love you Aaron. Don&#39;t forget me.

//Today, beneath the empire of Tiberius, I bury one of my loved ones, again. I hope this will be the last one. I think I&#39;m the last one. The only thing that remains of the entirety of my family, is me.//

//It was a rough time. I and my brother lost our father; he was a merchant and was attacked by looters who stole all of his earnings and slaughtered him. I and Marcus were ordered by governor Pilato, to crucify three prisoners. That day I saw the eyes of a man, that was innocent and yet condemned.//

//Having to go home, I left my beloved brother to handle the execution: I got permission from the office to go home, where my kids and my wife were waiting for me. After having lunch I managed to close my eyes and fell asleep. I was awakened by Marcus, he broke into tears the moment I woke up. His armor was covered in blood and he could barely talk. Once he calmed down, I demand to know what happened. When the first one expired the sky went black and a dense mist started crawling nearby the corpse. Marcus wandered through the fog until he saw someone. When he asked the man to turn around he saw our father&#39;s face. Filled with fear, he tried to run but the spirit followed him. He stumbled. The creature was still behind him. He held his spear tight and told the entity to stop. The creature had the same voice as our father. The creature was going to grab him but, he killed it instead. I tried to calm him down and to reason with him, telling that only Zeus was able to do such a thing and that maybe he was just tired. He told me that he had done something horrible that will have serious consequences; he felt he had done something wrong. Marcus begged me to believe him but in front of me, there was just a confused scared man. In the grip of rage, he left home.//

//The next morning I and my brother were supposed to work together. I could try to ask for forgiveness and listen more carefully to his story. It was a shame: I found him on the path to the palace, slaughtered. I was told that some cultists took his life because they thought he killed a demi-God. He was the first to die.//

//Many followed him, and everyone in the same way. Iulia my adored wife, and my two sons, Caius and Sempronius, my adored children, experienced the same fate as Marcus. A thief entered my house while I was working; a friend of mine told me that someone entered my place from the roof. I found my children and my wife with the blood pouring out of their necks; that view sentenced me to a meaningless life. I was supposed to die that night, not to stay alive. Then my cousins, my nephews, my mother, and so long. I&#39;m the only one left; all my family members passed away, hundreds of them. Now I&#39;ll wait, in my empty house, devoid of any joy. I hope that Pluto will soon welcome me to the underworld. I hope this will end soon. I hope to be the only one left. I hope that this curse will follow me to the grave.//

**We got your back this time. I&#39;m not sure will be able to do such a thing again in the future**
