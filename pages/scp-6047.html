**Item #:** SCP-6047

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**
&#34;Special Containment Procedures were updated after a more cost effective solution was found, diesel is cheaper than the cost of these clown&#39;s burger consumption&#34; - **Dr. Mason**
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Original Special Containment Procedures&#34; hide=&#34;- Original Special Containment Procedures&#34;]]
Instances of SCP-6047 are to be housed in separate rubber cells, each with a minimum of 5m^^2^^ walking space.
Each of the cells, have been constructed with special feeding tubes, which are to dispense one //McDonald&#39;s//brand burger, every 1.5 minutes, that the housed entity is awake. //(They tend to rest from 18:00-02:00)//

It is of utmost importance that the burgers dispensed, are from the American menu selection 1963-2016. And that the burgers are packaged in McDonalds branding from that period. Feeding them burgers from another time period or country, will confuse and aggravate SCP-6047 creatures, resulting in housing damages and or self-harm.

The feeding tubes must be refilled each morning. There should be a minimum of 660 burgers in each tube every morning. And a larger burger reserve, in the case of emergencies.

Maintenance of each cell and the feeding tubes within, are to take place once every week, and an extra holding cell, is to be used by SCP-6047 entities, when maintenance takes place, or in the case of an emergency breakdown. Additionally, cat-walks above each cell can be accessed to manually throw burgers down to each of the entities, to lure the individual entities around for maintenance, testing, or in case of power-outages and emergencies

Instances of SCP-6047 are to be continuously driven around a stretch of 8.Km, and be kept under the impression: that they are heading to a far away //McDonald&#39;s restaurant.// By way, of showing McDonald&#39;s signage and advertising along the path of the drive. The placement of signage, trees and rocks are randomly repositioned, as to not have SCP-6047 realize they&#39;re driving on a repeated road. Fortunately their cognitive abilities are not great, so the illusion is very easy to maintain. The stretch also features a few paths, one leading to a gas-station, and another to a fake McDonald&#39;s Restaurant.

The gas-station doubles as an auto-shop to maintain and refuel the different cars carrying SCP-6047 entities, and upon arrival, another car must be available, to take over the driving.

The fake McDonald&#39;s Restaurant, are used at a point when SCP-6047 are considered to be too aggravated and hungry to be driven, and helps to calm them down. Normally the building&#39;s drive-through is used, as there is then no need to leave the vehicle. Upon arrival at the teleprompter, an automated voice will ask for an order, SCP-6047 entities then promptly reply with &#34;Burger!&#34; and or incomprehensible groaning and mumbling. When the car then arrives at the delivery window, a machine on the inside will dispense 8 burgers into the carriage. The vehicle must drive off before SCP-6047 entities have finished their meals, so the driving illusion can start anew.

As well as the drive-through, the interior of the Mcdonald&#39;s restaurant, also doubles as a duplicate of the lab used in the original Containment Procedures, which can easily be accessed in-case of unwieldy weather conditions, or more tests.

**Description:** SCP-6047 is a group of 4 humanoid entities, each sharing resemblance with that of Ronald McDonald[[footnote]] Ronald McDonald is a fictional character created by, and for The McDonalds company.  [[/footnote]]

Instances&#39; DNA share close resemblance with that of humans, but differ in part due to their unusual skin pigmentation //(giving them the appearance of wearing makeup,)//
extra-ordinary metabolism, hunger, strength and ████████

SCP-6047 turns extremely aggravated, when not consuming food under the McDonalds brand, leading to extreme violence on anyone in it&#39;s vicinity, or - if alone, self harm. If given the opportunity, SCP-6047 instances will consume 5 burgers per minute, until it falls asleep. Research have narrowed it down that 1 burger every 1.5 minute, will keep SCP-6047 instances contempt.

Interestingly - if entities are under the impression that a burger is on the way to them, they will remain contempt for much longer. Making sure entities continue believing that can be difficult however.

SCP-6047 was discovered on ██-██-2016 After a report of &#34;homicidal McDonald&#39;s clowns&#34; were terrorizing a McDonald&#39;s Restaurant in ██████ Kentucky. SCP-foundation action took place shortly thereafter. witnesses were memory wiped, and a short misinformation campaign took place.</textarea></pre>
